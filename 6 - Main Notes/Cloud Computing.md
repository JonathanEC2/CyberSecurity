IF not an MSP, install a CASB between the local network and cloud providers
### CloudHopper

### CloudBorne Attack
- Cloudborne attack;; occurs as a result of a vulnerability in a bare metal servers reclamation process used by MSPs that provide IaaS. Attacker can install firmware backdoor on a  server that is later reclaimed or repurposed
