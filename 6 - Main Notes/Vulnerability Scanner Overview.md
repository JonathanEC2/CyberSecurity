# Vulnerability Scanner Overview


Weaknesses are known as vulnerabilities. The process of fixing vulnerabilities is known as patching. 

Digital devices also have vulnerabilities inside their software or hardware. These are the weaknesses in the software programs or hardware that an attacker can leverage to compromise the digital device. They are not easily noticed until you dedicate yourself to hunting them down. 

## Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is the inspection of digital systems to find weaknesses. Vulnerability scanning is an important compliance requirement for many regulatory bodies. 

#### Authenticated vs. Unauthenticated Scans

Authenticated scans require the hosts credentials and are more detailed than the unauthenticated scans. They help discover the threat surface within the hosts. Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the attackers having access to the host.

Unauthenticated scans do not use credentials and help identify the threat surface from outside the host.  It is less resource-intensive and straightforward to set up. An example would be scanning a public-facing website for vulnerabilities that any user can exploit.

#### Internal vs. External Scans

Internal scans focus on the vulnerabilities that can be exploited from inside the network. They identify what would be exposed to the attackers once they get inside the network. 

External scans focus on the vulnerabilities that can be exploited from outside the network. They identify what is exposed to the attacker outside the network

## CVE & CVSS

#### CVE

CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.  CVE number is a unique number given to vulnerabilities.
