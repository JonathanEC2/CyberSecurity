#webhacking
- SNMP3 is the only version that supports authentication and encryption
- XXS;; inserts malicious scripts into input fields on a web form. Mitigates with server-side input validation or setting HttpOnly flag
- Server-Side request;; Forgery web app vuln that enables an attacker to use the app to make HTTP requests to other domains
- XSRF least likely to be mitigated by input validation. Mitigated using CAPTCHA and random challenge tokens

- sitemap.xml;; is a detailed XML listing of paths, pages, videos, and other files on a website.
- robots.txt ;; the location of restricted files or directories
- humans.txt;; contact info that can be used for social engineering purposes
-

# APIs
- SOAP API;; uses HTTP and XML to communicate. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">More resource intensive</span> than REST, does not run JSON
- REST API ;;uses JSON and XML to encode. Performed by sending HTTP requests to HTTP servers. Often enables by 3rd party app developers
- XML-RPC;; developed in 1998, HTTP based call-methods for communicating between apps. Sends HTTP requests containing one or more parameter to a server and receives an HTTP response that contains a single result in XML

XML returns data as HTML-like tags
JSON returns data in the form of objects that contain key and value pairs
# HTTP Attacks
- slowloris attack
	- rate-limit bounding decreases the amount of time that a connection is allowed to remain open on the server
	- increasing server availability is a temporary fix because DDoS attackers can scale up their attack
	- reverse proxy is a long term fix, but legitimate users would still be unavailable during the attack

- HTTrack Website copier would allow you to view website directory structure that is not obvious to casual users
- php scripts are backend, not in HTML code


### php.ini
error_log determines the path and file name of the error log that is enabled by log errors
log_errors  determines whether the PHP error message will be written to a log on the file system
error_reporting determines the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">level</span> at which the PHP process will produce error messages
display_errors whether errors that are generated by PHP are displayed in a browser when a user or developer attempts to visit a page that is being generated by PHP
### Curl
curl -s;;used to silence error messages
curl -d;; delimiter
curl -f;; field parse
curl -o;; output
curl -q;; ignores the curl config file during execution

\ escape for ""
| cut -d "\"" -f 2 reduces the output to include only the URL contained in each hyperlink


# SQL
- SQL spacing;; when there is no space between SQL query 
- SQL variation;; modifies SQL query so that the syntax is different from what IDS expects but gets same results (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Ex: Instead of 1=1, it'd say "1" = "1"</span>)
 -  SQL asterisk/ ;;multiline comment
- SQL -- ;;regular comment
- SQL '   ;; is used to denote a character string
- SQL @;; denotes variable

Boolean 1=1 or 1=2 true or false

heavy query;; simulates a delay. They retrieve a large amount of data, requiring the DBV to execute
# Other

mod_negotiation;; enables you to disable file extensions on the server
SSO;; establishes credentials that are used to access network resources
GNU bashing sends specially crafted environment variable and trailing commands


- baselining;; monitoring security configuration changes over time
- change management;; documents changes to systems so that negative effects from changes can be avoided
