# Attacks
## DNS/ARP attacks
- ARP poisoning/spoofing;; associates attackers MAC with IP
- Switch spoofing;; characterized by using Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) to negotiate with a switch port in order to capture all traffic that is allowed on a trunk. 
- STP attack ;; lowest priority on root bridge
- DNS spoofing/cache poising;; Attacker queries DNS server. Attacker quickly forgers many responses to trick DNS sever into believing the attackers responses are from the authoritative name server. Then inserts <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">malicious name resolution</span> to IP data in a DNS server. When target queries DNS server, reply directs target to a different website
- DNS Amplification/reflection;; attackers sends a flood of DNS queries from their own servers, but the queries contain spoofed source addresses that are sent to the address of target




- Session fixation;; attack involves attacker accessing a web application by using the session ID of a logged-in user. Attacker sends link containing URL to a person who has and account on a web server. If user click link, attacker can also access the site using the same URL/SID combination
- Session donation;; attacker uses URL with their own SID to link trick t he victim into divulging sensitive information
- TCP hijacking;; requires you to be able to determine Initial Sequence Number (ISN)
- Teardrop;; DoS attack
- VLAN hopping;; attacker attempts to inject packets into another VLANs by accessing the VLAN trunk and double tagging 802.1Q frames
