DROWN attack;; exploits vuln. in SSLv2 connections

Twofish;; 128 bit block cipher that uses keys 128 through 256 bits in length
Blowfish;; 64 bit block cipher, keys ranging from 32 to 448 bits
AES;; 128 196 and 256
IDEA;; 64 bit block, 128 bit key
Software Encryption Algorithm (SEAL) 160 bit key

timing attacks;; also known as side channel

RSA;; susceptible to chosen ciphertext because an attacker can use victims public key to encrypt plain text and then decrypt the resulting ciphertext in order to determine patterns that can be exploited

chosen ciphertext;; attacker uses decryption tool to decrypt chosen cipher message in attempt to discover the key
adaptive chosen plaintext;; attacker modifies ciphertext slightly to see how changes affect the decrypted text
known plaintext;; attacker has access to both plaintext and ciphertext. Attacker will use plaintext and cipher text to attempt to extract the encryption key
Chosen plaintext;; attacker has access to both plaintext and ciphertext and can choose the plaintext to be encrypted

private keys are used to encrypt and encrypt the body of the message
digital signature encrypts hash using private key

trusted platform module (TPM) endorsement key is created when a TPM is manufactured
