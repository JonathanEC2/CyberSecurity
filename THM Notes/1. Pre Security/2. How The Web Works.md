# DNS in Detail

## What is DNS

- DNS (Domain Name System) ==provides a simple way for us to communicate with devices on the internet without remembering complex numbers.==
<!--SR:!2025-07-18,116,270-->
  
## Domain Hierarchy

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeBPWCGk1RGM2Erq1-ozDU7Lt3ZMI5LL1yHlbS5LC9TV7dDV7rO9fO_zQk9LMtbmudZmsIexGKJKJfE3TxXCE9SrefilT1t5hcH-j29vCbHtE-HW3g48-B8vgAyAE-UnawGe9p5SAQFURBSOm5TIdrchuch?key=NTq2Pa0rYJiIgYCFBEZvGg)

## Record Types

- A Records ;; resolve to IPv4 addresses
<!--SR:!2025-03-28,44,290-->
- AAAA Records ;; resolve IPv6 addresses
<!--SR:!2025-03-25,41,290-->
- CNAME Records ;; resolve to another domain name, for example, TryHackMe's online shop has the subdomain name store.tryhackme.com which returns a CNAME record shops.shopify.com
<!--SR:!2025-03-25,30,210-->
- MX Records ;; resolve to the address of the servers that handle the email for the domain you are querying
<!--SR:!2025-05-04,74,270-->
- TXT records are ;; free text fields where any text-based data can be stored.
<!--SR:!2025-03-27,43,270-->

## Making a DNS Request
?
1. When you request a domain name, your computer first checks its local cache to see if you've previously looked up the address recently; if not, a request to your Recursive DNS Server will be made.
2. Your ISP usually provides a Recursive DNS Server. This server also has a local cache of recently looked-up domain names. If a result is found locally, this is sent back to your computer, and your request ends here.
3. The root servers act as the DNS backbone of the internet; their job is to redirect you to the correct Top Level Domain Server.
4. The TLD server holds records for where to find the authoritative server to answer the DNS request. The authoritative server is often also known as the nameserver for the domain.
5. An authoritative DNS server is the server that is responsible for storing the DNS records for a particular domain name and where any updates to your domain name DNS records would be made. Depending on the record type, the DNS record is then sent back to the Recursive DNS Server, where a local copy will be cached for future requests and then relayed back to the original client that made the request.

# HTTP In Detail

## What is HTTP(S)

HTTP is ==the set of rules used for communicating with web servers for the transmission of webpage data, whether that is HTML, Images, Videos, etc. ==
<!--SR:!2025-05-16,64,230-->

## Requests And Responses

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdlH6Gj6-Nu4YblT88kvlJQfQPpg3ppMl_Nha_jEWiooHbkMrBIeGowj-IWKpCaUdTxl9mmKhgSjrPehk4nFGbTYKycJuzq9t5g29kfL8qdW2YIoZD3OwxOoSi0WFqhCVm_iRqFN8G-jBYQwqHDGBy-lMQ?key=NTq2Pa0rYJiIgYCFBEZvGg)


  A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is ==an instruction on how to access a resource on the internet==
<!--SR:!2025-06-01,98,290-->

**Example Request:**

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: tryhackme.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0
Referer: https://tryhackme.com/

**Breakdown:** 

Line 1: This request is sending the GET method request the home page with / and telling the web server we are using HTTP protocol version 1.1.
Line 2: tells the web server we want the website tryhackme.com
Line 3: tells the web server we are using the Firefox version 87 Browser
Line 4: we tell the web server that the web page that referred us to this one is https://tryhackme.com
Line 5: HTTP requests always end with a blank line to inform the web server that the request has finished.

## HTTP Methods

HTTP methods are a way for the client to show their intended action when making an HTTP request.

- GET Request is used to ;; get information from a web server.
<!--SR:!2025-04-23,59,250-->
- POST Request is used for ;; submitting data to the web server and potentially creating new records. Always validate and clean input to avoid SQL and XXS
<!--SR:!2025-04-07,36,210-->
- PUT Request is used for ;; submitting data to a web server to update information. Make sure user is authorized to make changes before accepting requests
<!--SR:!2025-04-25,54,250-->
- DELETE Request is used to ;; delete information/records from a web server. Make sure user is authorized to make changes
<!--SR:!2025-07-10,112,290-->
- PATCH;; Updates part of a resource
<!--SR:!2025-03-31,40,267-->
- HEAD;; Only retrieves headers
<!--SR:!2025-04-27,63,287-->
- OPTIONS;; Tells you what methods are available for a specific resource
<!--SR:!2025-04-13,53,267-->
- TRACE;; Similar to options, it shows what methods are allowed, often for debugging
<!--SR:!2025-04-05,34,227-->
- CONNECT;; used to create secure connections, like for HTTPS
<!--SR:!2025-03-28,37,287-->
## HTTP Status Codes

| 100-199 - Information Response | These are sent to tell the client the first part of their request has been accepted and they should continue sending the rest of their request. These codes are no longer very common. |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200-299 - Success              | This range of status codes is used to tell the client their request was successful.                                                                                                    |
| 300-399 - Redirection          | These are used to redirect the client's request to another resource. This can be either to a different webpage or a different website altogether.                                      |
| 400-499 - Client Errors        | Used to inform the client that there was an error with their request.                                                                                                                  |
| 500-599 - Server Errors        | This is reserved for errors happening on the server-side and usually indicates quite a major problem with the server handling the request.                                             |

| 200 - OK                     | The request was completed successfully.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 201 - Created                | A resource has been created (for example a new user or new blog post).                                                                                                                                                       |
| 301 - Moved Permanently      | This redirects the client's browser to a new webpage or tells search engines that the page has moved somewhere else and to look there instead.                                                                               |
| 302 - Found                  | Similar to the above permanent redirect, but as the name suggests, this is only a temporary change and it may change again in the near future.                                                                               |
| 400 - Bad Request            | This tells the browser that something was either wrong or missing in their request. This could sometimes be used if the web server resource that is being requested expects a certain parameter that the client didn't send. |
| 401 - Not Authorized         | You are not currently allowed to view this resource until you have authorized with the web application, most commonly with a username and password.                                                                          |
| 403 - Forbidden              | You do not have permission to view this resource whether you are logged in or not.                                                                                                                                           |
| 404 - Page Not Found         | The page/resource you requested does not exist.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 405 - Method Not Allowed     | The resource does not allow this method request, for example, you send a GET request to the resource /create-account when it was expecting a POST request instead.                                                           |
| 500 - Internal Service Error | The server has encountered some kind of error with your request that it doesn't know how to handle properly.                                                                                                                 |
| 503 - Service Unavailable    | This server cannot handle your request as it's either overloaded or down for maintenance.                                                                                                                                    |

## Headers

#### Common Request Headers

- Host;; by providing the host headers you can tell it which website you require, otherwise you'll just receive the default website for the server.
<!--SR:!2025-03-30,39,250-->
- User-Agent;; This is your browser software and version number
<!--SR:!2025-04-12,32,190-->
- Referrer ;; Indicates the URL from which the request came from.
<!--SR:!2025-04-04,44,268-->
- Content-Length;; tells the web server how much data to expect in the web request. This way the server can ensure it isn't missing any data.
<!--SR:!2025-06-26,95,250-->
- Accept-Encoding;; Tells the web server what types of compression methods the browser supports so the data can be made smaller for transmitting over the internet.
<!--SR:!2025-03-26,42,250-->
- Cookie;; Data sent to the server to help remember your information (see cookies task for more information).
<!--SR:!2025-07-08,119,290-->

#### Common Response Headers
- Date ;; the exact date and time when the response wad generated by the server
<!--SR:!2025-07-25,123,308-->
- Content-Type;; This tells the client what type of data is being returned, i.e., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Images, PDF, Video, etc. Using the content-type header the browser then knows how to process the data.
<!--SR:!2025-05-11,81,270-->
- Server ;; What kind of server software is handling the request. Good for debugging but can also <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reveal server information that might be useful for attacks</span>
<!--SR:!2025-04-19,54,268-->
- Set-Cookie;;  Information to store which gets sent back to the web server on each request (see cookies task for more information). Make sure cookies are set with **HttpOnly** flag and **Secure** flag
<!--SR:!2025-03-25,1,130-->
- Cache-Control;; How long to store the content of the response in the browser's cache before it requests it again.
<!--SR:!2025-05-12,62,230-->
- Location ;; used in redirection responses. Tell the client where to go next if resource has moved. Validate and sanitize to avoid redirection to harmful websites
<!--SR:!2025-05-17,58,228-->
- Content-Encoding;; What method has been used to compress the data to make it smaller when sending it over the internet.
<!--SR:!2025-04-06,35,210-->



# How Websites Work

When you visit a website, your browser makes a request to a web server asking for information about the page you're visiting. A web server is just a dedicated computer somewhere else in the world that handles your requests.

Two major components that make up a website:
	- Front End (Client-Side) - the way your browser renders a website.
	- Back End (Server-Side) - a server that processes your request and returns a response.


Sensitive Data Exposure occurs when a website doesn't properly protect (or remove) sensitive clear-text information to the end-user; usually found in a site's frontend source code.  A website developer may have forgotten to remove login credentials, hidden links to private parts of the website or other sensitive data shown in HTML or JavaScript.

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Whenever you're assessing a web application for security issues, one of the first things you should do is review the page source code to see if you can find any exposed login credentials or hidden links.
</mark>
## Putting it all together

- A CDN (Content Delivery Network) can be an excellent resource for cutting down traffic to a busy website. It allows you to host static files from your website across thousands of servers all over the world. When a user requests one of the hosted files, the CDN works out where the nearest server is physically located and sends the request there instead of potentially the other side of the world.
- Database stores information

- A WAF sits between ==your web request and the web server; its primary purpose is to protect the web server from hacking or denial of service attacks. ==
<!--SR:!2025-05-26,67,230-->
  

A **web server** is software that ==listens for incoming connections and then utilizes the HTTP protocol to deliver web content to its clients==. The most common web server software you'll come across is Apache, Nginx, IIS, and NodeJS.
<!--SR:!2025-04-01,12,190--> 

Web servers can host multiple websites with different domain names; to achieve this, they use virtual hosts. The web server software checks the hostname being requested from the HTTP headers and matches that against its virtual hosts (virtual hosts are just text-based configuration files). If it finds a match, the correct website will be provided. If no match is found, the default website will be provided instead.
