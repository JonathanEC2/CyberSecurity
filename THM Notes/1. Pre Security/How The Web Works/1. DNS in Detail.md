## What is DNS

- DNS (Domain Name System) ==provides a simple way for us to communicate with devices on the internet without remembering complex numbers.==

## Making a DNS Request
?
1. When you request a domain name, your computer first checks its local cache to see if you've previously looked up the address recently; if not, a request to your Recursive DNS Server will be made.
2. Your ISP usually provides a Recursive DNS Server. This server also has a local cache of recently looked-up domain names. If a result is found locally, this is sent back to your computer, and your request ends here.
3. The root servers act as the DNS backbone of the internet; their job is to redirect you to the correct Top Level Domain Server.
4. The TLD server holds records for where to find the authoritative server to answer the DNS request. The authoritative server is often also known as the nameserver for the domain.
5. An authoritative DNS server is the server that is responsible for storing the DNS records for a particular domain name and where any updates to your domain name DNS records would be made. Depending on the record type, the DNS record is then sent back to the Recursive DNS Server, where a local copy will be cached for future requests and then relayed back to the original client that made the request.
