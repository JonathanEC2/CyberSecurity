## What is HTTP(S)

HTTP is ==the set of rules used for communicating with web servers for the transmission of webpage data, whether that is HTML, Images, Videos, etc. ==
<!--SR:!2025-05-16,64,230-->

## Requests And Responses

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdlH6Gj6-Nu4YblT88kvlJQfQPpg3ppMl_Nha_jEWiooHbkMrBIeGowj-IWKpCaUdTxl9mmKhgSjrPehk4nFGbTYKycJuzq9t5g29kfL8qdW2YIoZD3OwxOoSi0WFqhCVm_iRqFN8G-jBYQwqHDGBy-lMQ?key=NTq2Pa0rYJiIgYCFBEZvGg)


  A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is ==an instruction on how to access a resource on the internet==
<!--SR:!2025-06-01,98,290-->

**Example Request:**

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: tryhackme.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0
Referer: https://tryhackme.com/

**Breakdown:** 

Line 1: This request is sending the GET method request the home page with / and telling the web server we are using HTTP protocol version 1.1.
Line 2: tells the web server we want the website tryhackme.com
Line 3: tells the web server we are using the Firefox version 87 Browser
Line 4: we tell the web server that the web page that referred us to this one is https://tryhackme.com
Line 5: HTTP requests always end with a blank line to inform the web server that the request has finished.

## HTTP Methods

HTTP methods are a way for the client to show their intended action when making an HTTP request.

- GET Request is used to ;; get information from a web server.
<!--SR:!2025-04-23,59,250-->
- POST Request is used for ;; submitting data to the web server and potentially creating new records. Always validate and clean input to avoid SQL and XXS
<!--SR:!2025-06-27,73,210-->
- PUT Request is used for ;; submitting data to a web server to update information. Make sure user is authorized to make changes before accepting requests
<!--SR:!2025-04-25,54,250-->
- DELETE Request is used to ;; delete information/records from a web server. Make sure user is authorized to make changes
<!--SR:!2025-07-10,112,290-->
- PATCH;; Updates part of a resource
<!--SR:!2025-07-30,106,267-->
- HEAD;; Only retrieves headers
<!--SR:!2025-04-27,63,287-->
- OPTIONS;; Tells you what methods are available for a specific resource
<!--SR:!2025-05-11,26,247-->
- TRACE;; Similar to options, it shows what methods are allowed, often for debugging
<!--SR:!2025-06-30,76,227-->
- CONNECT;; used to create secure connections, like for HTTPS
<!--SR:!2025-07-14,106,287-->
## HTTP Status Codes

| 100-199 - Information Response | These are sent to tell the client the first part of their request has been accepted and they should continue sending the rest of their request. These codes are no longer very common. |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200-299 - Success              | This range of status codes is used to tell the client their request was successful.                                                                                                    |
| 300-399 - Redirection          | These are used to redirect the client's request to another resource. This can be either to a different webpage or a different website altogether.                                      |
| 400-499 - Client Errors        | Used to inform the client that there was an error with their request.                                                                                                                  |
| 500-599 - Server Errors        | This is reserved for errors happening on the server-side and usually indicates quite a major problem with the server handling the request.                                             |

| 200 - OK                     | The request was completed successfully.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 201 - Created                | A resource has been created (for example a new user or new blog post).                                                                                                                                                       |
| 301 - Moved Permanently      | This redirects the client's browser to a new webpage or tells search engines that the page has moved somewhere else and to look there instead.                                                                               |
| 302 - Found                  | Similar to the above permanent redirect, but as the name suggests, this is only a temporary change and it may change again in the near future.                                                                               |
| 400 - Bad Request            | This tells the browser that something was either wrong or missing in their request. This could sometimes be used if the web server resource that is being requested expects a certain parameter that the client didn't send. |
| 401 - Not Authorized         | You are not currently allowed to view this resource until you have authorized with the web application, most commonly with a username and password.                                                                          |
| 403 - Forbidden              | You do not have permission to view this resource whether you are logged in or not.                                                                                                                                           |
| 404 - Page Not Found         | The page/resource you requested does not exist.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 405 - Method Not Allowed     | The resource does not allow this method request, for example, you send a GET request to the resource /create-account when it was expecting a POST request instead.                                                           |
| 500 - Internal Service Error | The server has encountered some kind of error with your request that it doesn't know how to handle properly.                                                                                                                 |
| 503 - Service Unavailable    | This server cannot handle your request as it's either overloaded or down for maintenance.                                                                                                                                    |

## Headers

#### Common Request Headers

- Host;; by providing the host headers you can tell it which website you require, otherwise you'll just receive the default website for the server.
<!--SR:!2025-07-06,98,250-->
- User-Agent;; This is your browser software and version number
<!--SR:!2025-07-11,87,210-->
- Referrer ;; Indicates the URL from which the request came from.
<!--SR:!2025-08-12,119,268-->
- Content-Length;; tells the web server how much data to expect in the web request. This way the server can ensure it isn't missing any data.
<!--SR:!2025-06-26,95,250-->
- Accept-Encoding;; Tells the web server what types of compression methods the browser supports so the data can be made smaller for transmitting over the internet.
<!--SR:!2025-07-12,107,250-->
- Cookie;; Data sent to the server to help remember your information (see cookies task for more information).
<!--SR:!2025-07-08,119,290-->

#### Common Response Headers
- Date ;; the exact date and time when the response wad generated by the server
<!--SR:!2025-07-25,123,308-->
- Content-Type;; This tells the client what type of data is being returned, i.e., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Images, PDF, Video, etc. Using the content-type header the browser then knows how to process the data.
<!--SR:!2025-05-11,81,270-->
- Server ;; What kind of server software is handling the request. Good for debugging but can also <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reveal server information that might be useful for attacks</span>
<!--SR:!2025-09-14,145,268-->
- Set-Cookie;;  Information to store which gets sent back to the web server on each request (see cookies task for more information). Make sure cookies are set with **HttpOnly** flag and **Secure** flag
<!--SR:!2025-04-23,1,130-->
- Cache-Control;; How long to store the content of the response in the browser's cache before it requests it again.
<!--SR:!2025-05-12,62,230-->
- Location ;; used in redirection responses. Tell the client where to go next if resource has moved. Validate and sanitize to avoid redirection to harmful websites
<!--SR:!2025-05-17,58,228-->
- Content-Encoding;; What method has been used to compress the data to make it smaller when sending it over the internet.
<!--SR:!2025-06-28,74,210-->
