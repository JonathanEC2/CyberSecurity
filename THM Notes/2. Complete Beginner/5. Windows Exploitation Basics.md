# Active Directory Basics

 A Windows domain is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given business. The main idea behind a domain is to centralize the administration of common components of a Windows computer network in a single repository called Active Directory (AD). The server that runs the Active Directory services is known as a Domain Controller (DC).

The main advantages of having a configured Windows domain are:
- Centralized identity management: All users across the network can be configured from Active Directory with minimum effort.
- Managing security policies: You can configure security policies directly from Active Directory and apply them to users and computers across the network as needed.



﻿The core of any Windows Domain is the Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS). This service acts as a catalog that holds the information of all of the "objects" that exist on your network. Amongst the many objects supported by AD, we have users, groups, machines, printers, shares and many others.  A security principal is an object that can act upon resources in the network.

  

- OUs are handy for applying policies to users and computers, which include specific configurations that pertain to sets of users depending on their particular role in the enterprise. Remember, a user can only be a member of a single OU at a time, as it wouldn't make sense to try to apply two different sets of policies to a single user.
- Security Groups, on the other hand, are used to grant permissions over resources. For example, you will use groups if you want to allow some users to access a shared folder or network printer. A user can be a part of many groups, which is needed to grant access to multiple resources.
    


 Group Policy Objects (GPO)  are simply a collection of settings that can be applied to OUs. GPOs can contain policies aimed at either users or computers, allowing you to set a baseline on specific machines and identities. To configure Group Policies, you first create a GPO under Group Policy Objects and then link it to the OU where you want the policies to apply


Any GPO will apply to the linked OU and any sub-OUs under it.

GPOs are distributed to the network via a network share called SYSVOL, which is stored in the DC. All users in a domain should typically have access to this share over the network to sync their GPOs periodically.


When using Windows domains, all credentials are stored in the Domain Controllers. Whenever a user tries to authenticate to a service using domain credentials, the service will need to ask the Domain Controller to verify if they are correct. Two protocols can be used for network authentication in windows domains:


Kerberos: Used by any recent version of Windows. This is the default protocol in any recent domain.

NetNTLM: Legacy authentication protocol kept for compatibility purposes.

  

Kerberos Authentication

Kerberos authentication is the default authentication protocol for any recent version of Windows. Users who log into a service using Kerberos will be assigned tickets. Think of tickets as proof of a previous authentication. Users with tickets can present them to a service to demonstrate they have already authenticated into the network before and are therefore enabled to use it.

  

When Kerberos is used for authentication, the following process happens:

  

1. The user sends their username and a timestamp encrypted using a key derived from their password to the Key Distribution Center (KDC), a service usually installed on the Domain Controller in charge of creating Kerberos tickets on the network.
    

  

The KDC will create and send back a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), which will allow the user to request additional tickets to access specific services. The need for a ticket to get more tickets may sound a bit weird, but it allows users to request service tickets without passing their credentials every time they want to connect to a service. Along with the TGT, a Session Key is given to the user, which they will need to generate the following requests.

  

Notice the TGT is encrypted using the krbtgt account's password hash, and therefore the user can't access its contents. It is essential to know that the encrypted TGT includes a copy of the Session Key as part of its contents, and the KDC has no need to store the Session Key as it can recover a copy by decrypting the TGT if needed.

2. When a user wants to connect to a service on the network like a share, website or database, they will use their TGT to ask the KDC for a Ticket Granting Service (TGS). TGS are tickets that allow connection only to the specific service they were created for. To request a TGS, the user will send their username and a timestamp encrypted using the Session Key, along with the TGT and a Service Principal Name (SPN), which indicates the service and server name we intend to access.

  

As a result, the KDC will send us a TGS along with a Service Session Key, which we will need to authenticate to the service we want to access. The TGS is encrypted using a key derived from the Service Owner Hash. The Service Owner is the user or machine account that the service runs under. The TGS contains a copy of the Service Session Key on its encrypted contents so that the Service Owner can access it by decrypting the TGS.

3. The TGS can then be sent to the desired service to authenticate and establish a connection. The service will use its configured account's password hash to decrypt the TGS and validate the Service Session Key.

Trees, Forests and Trusts

 If you have two domains that share the same namespace (thm.local in our example), those domains can be joined into a Tree.

The union of several trees with different namespaces into the same network is known as a forest.

  

Having multiple domains organized in trees and forest allows you to have a nice compartmentalized network in terms of management and resources. But at a certain point, a user at THM UK might need to access a shared file in one of MHT ASIA servers. For this to happen, domains arranged in trees and forests are joined together by trust relationships.  In a one-way trust, if Domain AAA trusts Domain BBB, this means that a user on BBB can be authorized to access resources on AAA

# Metasploit: Introduction

The Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more. While the primary usage of the Metasploit Framework focuses on the penetration testing domain, it is also useful for vulnerability research and exploit development.

The main components of the Metasploit Framework can be summarized as follows;

- **msfconsole**: The main command-line interface.
- **Modules**: supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.
- **Tools**: Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing. Some of these tools are msfvenom, pattern_create and pattern_offset.
- **Exploit**: A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
- **Vulnerability**: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.
- **Payload**: An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.

**Encoders** will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them.

NOPs (No OPeration) do nothing, literally. They are often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes.

You will see four different directories under payloads: adapters, singles, stagers and stages.


- Adapters: An adapter wraps single payloads to convert them into different formats. For example, a normal single payload can be wrapped inside a Powershell adapter, which will make a single powershell command that will execute the payload.
- Singles: Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc.) that do not need to download an additional component to run.
- Stagers: Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. “Staged payloads” will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once.
- Stages: Downloaded by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payloads.

An important feature of msfconsole is the support of tab completion. For example, if you start typing he and press the tab key, you will see it auto-completes to help.

A session is an existing connection to the target system that the post-exploitation module will use.

The show command can be used in any context followed by a module type (auxiliary, payload, exploit, etc.) to list available modules. Further information on any module can be obtained by typing the info command within its context. It is good practice to use the show options command to list the required parameters.

Another essential piece of information returned is in the “rank” column. Exploits are rated based on their reliability

One of the most useful commands in msfconsole is search. This command will search the Metasploit Framework database for modules relevant to the given search parameter. You can conduct searches using CVE numbers, exploit names

Parameters you will often use are:

  

- **RHOSTS**: “Remote host”, the IP address of the target system. A single IP address or a network range can be set. This will support the CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation (/24, /16, etc.) or a network range (10.10.10.x – 10.10.10.y). You can also use a file where targets are listed, one target per line using file:/path/of/the/target_file.txt, as you can see below.
- **RPORT**: “Remote port”, the port on the target system the vulnerable application is running on.
- **PAYLOAD**: The payload you will use with the exploit.
- **LHOST**: “Localhost”, the attacking machine (your AttackBox or Kali Linux) IP address.
- **LPORT**: “Local port”, the port you will use for the reverse shell to connect back to. This is a port on your attacking machine, and you can set it to any port not used by any other application.
- **SESSION**: Each connection established to the target system using Metasploit will have a session ID. You will use this with post-exploitation modules that will connect to the target system using an existing connection.
    
The setg command allows you to set the value so it can be used by default across different modules. You can clear any value set with setg using unsetg.

# Metasploit: Exploitation

When performing service scans, it would be important not to omit more "exotic" services such as NetBIOS. NetBIOS (Network Basic Input Output System), similar to SMB, allows computers to communicate over the network to share files or send files to printers. The NetBIOS name of the target system can give you an idea about its role and even importance (e.g. CORP-DC, DEVOPS, SALES, etc.). You may also run across some shared files and folders that could be accessed either without a password or protected with a simple password (e.g. admin, administrator, root, toor, etc.).

Most of the exploits will have a preset default payload. However, you can always use the show payloads command to list other commands you can use with that specific exploit. Note that choosing a working payload could become a trial and error process due to environmental or OS restrictions such as firewall rules, anti-virus, file writing, or the program performing the payload execution isn't available

Once a session is opened, you can background it using CTRL+Z

Msfvenom, which replaced Msfpayload and Msfencode, allows you to generate payloads.

# Metasploit: Meterpreter

Meterpreter is a Metasploit payload that supports the penetration testing process with many valuable components. Meterpreter will run on the target system and act as an agent within a command and control architecture. You will interact with the target operating system and files and use Meterpreter's specialized commands.

Meterpreter runs on the target system but is not installed on it. It runs in memory and does not write itself to the disk on the target. This feature aims to avoid being detected during antivirus scans. By default, most antivirus software will scan new files on the disk (e.g. when you download a file from the internet) Meterpreter runs in memory (RAM - Random Access Memory) to avoid having a file that has to be written to the disk on the target system (e.g. meterpreter.exe). This way, Meterpreter will be seen as a process and not have a file on the target system

Meterpreter also aims to avoid being detected by network-based IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and IDS (Intrusion Detection System) solutions by using encrypted communication (TLS) with the server where Metasploit runs (typically your attacking machine). If the target organization does not decrypt and inspect encrypted traffic (e.g. HTTPS) coming to and going out of the local network, IPS and IDS solutions will not be able to detect its activities.

Every version of Meterpreter will have different command options, so running the help command is always a good idea. Commands are built-in tools available on Meterpreter. They will run on the target system without loading any additional script or executable files.

Migrating to another process will help Meterpreter interact with it. For example, if you see a word processor running on the target (e.g. word.exe, notepad.exe, etc.), you can migrate to it and start capturing keystrokes sent by the user to this process. Some Meterpreter versions will offer you the keyscan_start, keyscan_stop, and keyscan_dump command options to make Meterpreter act like a keylogger. Migrating to another process may also help you to have a more stable Meterpreter session.

The hashdump command will list the content of the SAM database.**
