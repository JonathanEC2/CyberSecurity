Ensures authentication, authenticity, and integrity

## Common Use of Asymmetric Encryption

We use asymmetric encryption to negotiate and agree on symmetric encryption ciphers and keys

Equivalent to sending a box with a lock (Public Key) to your friend that has its key (Private Key) that contains a secret code (symmetric encryption ciphers and keys)

## RSA

A public key encryption algorithm that enables secure data transmission over insecure channels. 

#### The Math That Makes RSA Secure

RSA is based on factoring a large number. It is tricky to determine what two prime numbers make very large numbers (more than 600 digits). 

#### RSA in CTFs

The math behind RSA comes up pretty often in CTFs, requiring you to calculate variables to break some encryption based on them. Some tools for defeating RSA challenges in CTFs:
 - [RsaCtfTool](https://github.com/Ganapati/RsaCtfTool)
  - [rsatool](https://github.com/ius/rsatool).

The main variables for RSA in CTFs: p, q, m, n, e, d, and c. As per our numerical example:

- p and q are large prime numbers
- n is the product of p and q
- The public key is n and e
- The private key is n and d
- m is used to represent the original message, i.e., plaintext
- c represents the encrypted text, i.e., ciphertext

#### Formula
$n = p * q$
$ϕn = n - p - q +1$
$e$ is a relative prime to $ϕn$
	relative prime means no other integer can divide between both numbers
$e * d$ 1 mod $ϕn$
public key is (n, e)
private key is (n, d)
Value you want to encrypt is x
$y = x^e$ mod n
$x = y^d$ mod n

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange 

Key exchange aims to establish a shared secret between two parties. It allows two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure communication channel without requiring a pre-existing shared secret.

Alice and Bob generate secrets independently; let’s call these secrets A and B. They also have some public common material; let’s call this C.

When secrets are combined, they are practically impossible to separate. The order in which they are combined does not matter. Alice and Bob will combine their secrets with the common secret to make AC and AB. They will then send these to each other to create two identical keys, ABC

Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is often used alongside RSA public key cryptography. Diffie-Hellman is used for key agreement, while RSA is used for digital signatures, key transport, and authentication, among many others.
#### Formula
p is a large prime number 
g is a generator where 0 < g < p
a an b are private keys of each party 
A and B are public keys
	$A = g^a$ mod p
	$B = g^b$ mod p
Parties **exchange** public keys
Calculate shared secret:
	 $B^a$ mod p
	 $A^b$ mod p

## SSH

#### Authenticating the Server
?
SSH will confirm whether we recognize the servers public key fingerprint. If SSH client doesn't recognize the key, it will confirm whether we want to continue with the connection because a man-in-the-middle attack is probable. In this case, the user must confirm the servers identity by checking the public key signature. Once you answer with “yes”, the SSH client will record this public key signature for this host.

#### Authenticating the Server

We now must identify ourselves and get authenticated. We should <u>avoid using passwords as they do not fall within the best security practices</u>. Configure the machine with key authentication instead. SSH keys are generated with RSA by default. You can choose which algorithm to generate and add a passphrase to encrypt the SSH key. 

<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">ssh-keygen</span> is the program usually used to generate key pairs. <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">man ssh-keygen </span>

- **DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)** is a public-key cryptography algorithm specifically designed for digital signatures.
- **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)** is a variant of DSA that uses elliptic curve cryptography to provide smaller key sizes for equivalent security.
- **ECDSA-SK (ECDSA with Security Key**) is an extension of ECDSA. It incorporates hardware-based security keys for enhanced private key protection.
- **Ed25519** is a public-key signature system using EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm) with Curve25519.
- **Ed25519-SK (Ed25519 with Security Key)** is a variant of Ed25519. Similar to ECDSA-SK, it uses a hardware-based security key for improved private key protection.

#### SSH Private Keys

Using tools like John the Ripper, you can attack an encrypted SSH key to attempt to find the passphrase

When generating an SSH key to log in to a remote machine, you should ==generate the keys on your machine and then copy the public key over, as this means the private key never exists on the target machine using <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">ssh-copy-id</span> ==

Permissions must be set correctly to use a private SSH key, otherwise your SSH client will ignore the file with a warning. Only the owner should be able to read or write to the private key (600 or stricter). <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">ssh -i {PRIVATE_KEY} user@host</span> is how you specify a key

The <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">~/.ssh</span> folder is the default place to store these keys for OpenSSH. The <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">authorized_keys</span> file in this directory holds public keys that are allowed access to the server if key authentication is enabled.

#### Using SSH Keys to Get a “Better Shell”

During CTFs, penetration testing, and red teaming exercises, SSH keys are an excellent way to “upgrade” a reverse shell, assuming the user has login enabled. Note that www-data usually does not allow this, but regular users and root will work. Leaving an SSH key in the<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)"> authorized_keys</span> file on a machine can be a useful backdoor.

## Digital Signatures and Certificates

Digital signatures provide a way to verify the authenticity and integrity of a digital message. Using asymmetric cryptography, **you can produce a digital signature with your <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">private key</mark>, which can be verified with your <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">public key</mark>** Only you should have access to your private key, which proves you signed the file.

Certificates are an essential application of public key cryptography, and they are also linked to digital signatures. They are widely used in HTTPS.

The web server has a certificate that says it is the real tryhackme.com. The certificate has a chain of trust starting with the CA. From install time, your device, operating system, and web browser automatically trust various root CAs. Certificates are only trusted when the Root CAs say they trust the organization that signed them. For example, the certificate is signed by an organization, the organization is trusted by a CA, and the CA is trusted by your browser. Therefore, your browser trusts the certificate. **Transitive trust**

## PGP and GPG

PGP implements encryption for encrypting file, performing digital signing, and more. GnuGP is an open source implementation of the OpenPGP standard

PGP is commonly used in email to protect the confidentiality of the email messages. It can also be used to sign an email message and confirm its integrity.

<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">gpg --full-gen-key</span> 

 With PGP/GPG, private keys can be protected with passphrases in a similar way that we protect SSH private keys. If the key is passphrase protected, you can attempt to crack it using John the Ripper and <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">gpg2john</span> 

Due to the importance of the GPG keys, it is vital that you keep a backup copy in a secure location.
