# Metasploit: Introduction

## Introduction to Metasploit

The Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more. While the primary usage of the Metasploit Framework focuses on the penetration testing domain, it is also useful for vulnerability research and exploit development.

## Main Components of Metasploit

The main components of the Metasploit Framework can be summarized as:

- **msfconsole**;; The main command-line interface.
- **Modules**;; supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.
- **Tools**;; Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing. Some of these tools are msfvenom, pattern_create and pattern_offset.
- **Exploit**: A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
- **Vulnerability**: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.
- **Payload**;; An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.

#### Encoders

**Encoders**;; will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them.

#### Evasion

**Evasion** modules  attempt to evade antivirus software. 
#### NOPs

**NOPs** (No OPeration) do nothing. They are often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes.

#### Payloads

You will see four different directories under payloads: adapters, singles, stagers and stages.

- **Adapters**;; An adapter wraps single payloads to convert them into different formats. For example, a normal single payload can be wrapped inside a Powershell adapter, which will make a single powershell command that will execute the payload.
- **Singles**;; Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe, etc.) that do not need to download an additional component to run.
- **Stagers**;; Responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system. Useful when working with staged payloads. “Staged payloads” will first upload a stager on the target system then download the rest of the payload (stage). This provides some advantages as the initial size of the payload will be relatively small compared to the full payload sent at once.
- **Stages**;; Downloaded by the stager. This will allow you to use larger sized payloads.

Metasploit has a subtle way to help you identify single (also called “inline”) payloads and staged payloads.

- generic/shell_reverse_tcp
- windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp

Both are reverse Windows shells. The former is an inline (or single) payload, as indicated by the “_” between “shell” and “reverse”. While the latter is a staged payload, as indicated by the “/” between “shell” and “reverse”.

## Msfconsole

An important feature of msfconsole is the support of tab completion. For example, if you start typing he and press the tab key, you will see it auto-completes to help.

A session is an existing connection to the target system that the post-exploitation module will use.

The <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">show</span> command can be used in any context followed by a module type (auxiliary, payload, exploit, etc.) to list available modules. Further information on any module can be obtained by typing the info command within its context. It is good practice to use the show options command to list the required parameters.

Another essential piece of information returned is in the “rank” column. Exploits are rated based on their reliability. [Exploit Ranking]([https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Exploit-Ranking](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Exploit-Ranking))

One of the most useful commands in msfconsole is <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">search</span>. This command will search the Metasploit Framework database for modules relevant to the given search parameter. You can conduct searches using CVE numbers, exploit names

## Working with modules

Parameters you will often use are:

- **RHOSTS**: “Remote host”, the IP address of the target system. A single IP address or a network range can be set. This will support the CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation (/24, /16, etc.) or a network range (10.10.10.x – 10.10.10.y). You can also use a file where targets are listed, one target per line using file:/path/of/the/target_file.txt
- **RPORT**: “Remote port”, the port on the target system the vulnerable application is running on.
- **PAYLOAD**: The payload you will use with the exploit.
- **LHOST**: “Localhost”, the attacking machine (your AttackBox or Kali Linux) IP address.
- **LPORT**: “Local port”, the port you will use for the reverse shell to connect back to. This is a port on your attacking machine, and you can set it to any port not used by any other application.
- **SESSION**: Each connection established to the target system using Metasploit will have a session ID. You will use this with post-exploitation modules that will connect to the target system using an existing connection.

You can override any set parameter using the set command again with a different value. You can also clear any parameter value using the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">unset</span> command or clear all set parameters with the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">unset all</span> command.

The <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">setg</span> command allows you to set the value so it can be used by default across different modules. You can clear any value set with setg using <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">unsetg</span>.

<b><font size = 4>Using Modules</font></b>

Once all module parameters are set, you can launch the module using the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">exploit</span> command. Metasploit also supports the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">run</span> command, which is an alias created for the exploit


<b><font size = 4>Sessions</font></b>

Once a vulnerability has been successfully exploited, a session will be created. This is the communication channel established between the target system and Metasploit.

You can use the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">background</span> command to background the session prompt and go back to the msfconsole prompt. Alternatively, you can use <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">CTRL+Z</span>

The <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">sessions</span> command can be used from the msfconsole prompt or any context to see the existing sessions.

The <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">exploit</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">-z </span>command will run the exploit and background the session as soon as it opens.
# Metasploit: Exploitation

When performing service scans, it would be important not to omit more "exotic" services such as NetBIOS. NetBIOS (Network Basic Input Output System), similar to SMB, allows computers to communicate over the network to share files or send files to printers. The NetBIOS name of the target system can give you an idea about its role and even importance (e.g. CORP-DC, DEVOPS, SALES, etc.). You may also run across some shared files and folders that could be accessed either without a password or protected with a simple password (e.g. admin, administrator, root, toor, etc.).

Most of the exploits will have a preset default payload. However, you can always use the show payloads command to list other commands you can use with that specific exploit. Note that choosing a working payload could become a trial and error process due to environmental or OS restrictions such as firewall rules, anti-virus, file writing, or the program performing the payload execution isn't available

Once a session is opened, you can background it using CTRL+Z

Msfvenom, which replaced Msfpayload and Msfencode, allows you to generate payloads.

# Metasploit: Meterpreter

Meterpreter is a Metasploit payload that supports the penetration testing process with many valuable components. Meterpreter will run on the target system and act as an agent within a command and control architecture. You will interact with the target operating system and files and use Meterpreter's specialized commands.

Meterpreter runs on the target system but is not installed on it. It runs in memory and does not write itself to the disk on the target. This feature aims to avoid being detected during antivirus scans. By default, most antivirus software will scan new files on the disk (e.g. when you download a file from the internet) Meterpreter runs in memory (RAM - Random Access Memory) to avoid having a file that has to be written to the disk on the target system (e.g. meterpreter.exe). This way, Meterpreter will be seen as a process and not have a file on the target system

Meterpreter also aims to avoid being detected by network-based IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and IDS (Intrusion Detection System) solutions by using encrypted communication (TLS) with the server where Metasploit runs (typically your attacking machine). If the target organization does not decrypt and inspect encrypted traffic (e.g. HTTPS) coming to and going out of the local network, IPS and IDS solutions will not be able to detect its activities.

Every version of Meterpreter will have different command options, so running the help command is always a good idea. Commands are built-in tools available on Meterpreter. They will run on the target system without loading any additional script or executable files.

Migrating to another process will help Meterpreter interact with it. For example, if you see a word processor running on the target (e.g. word.exe, notepad.exe, etc.), you can migrate to it and start capturing keystrokes sent by the user to this process. Some Meterpreter versions will offer you the keyscan_start, keyscan_stop, and keyscan_dump command options to make Meterpreter act like a keylogger. Migrating to another process may also help you to have a more stable Meterpreter session.

The <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">hashdump</span> command will list the content of the SAM database.
