#metasploit

When performing service scans, it would be important not to omit more "exotic" services such as NetBIOS. NetBIOS (Network Basic Input Output System), similar to SMB, allows computers to communicate over the network to share files or send files to printers. The NetBIOS name of the target system can give you an idea about its role and even importance (e.g. CORP-DC, DEVOPS, SALES, etc.). You may also run across some shared files and folders that could be accessed either without a password or protected with a simple password (e.g. admin, administrator, root, toor, etc.).

Most of the exploits will have a preset default payload. However, you can always use the **show payloads** command to list other commands you can use with that specific exploit. Note that choosing a working payload could become a trial and error process due to environmental or OS restrictions such as firewall rules, anti-virus, file writing, or the program performing the payload execution isn't available

Once a session is opened, you can background it using CTRL+Z
