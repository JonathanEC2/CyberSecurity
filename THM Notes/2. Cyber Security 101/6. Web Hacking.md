# Web Application Basics

## Web Application Overview


**Front end** is the part of the web application that you can interact with (HTML, CSS, JS)
**Back end is** the part of the web application that you cannot see but are important to the web applications function. 
	- **Database**: where information is stored, modified, and retrieved. 
	- **Infrastructure**: web servers, application servers, storage, various network devices
	- **WAF**: Filters out dangerous requests away from web servers and provides an element of protection

## Uniform Resource Locator

[[../1. Pre Security/2. How The Web Works##Requests And Responses | URL]]

## HTTP Messages

HTTP messages are ;; packets of data exchanged between a user and the web server. These are important for understanding how web applications work because they show how users' request and server's response are communicated
<!--SR:!2025-04-18,44,244-->

**HTTP Requests**: Sent by the user to trigger actions on the web application.
**HTTP Responses**: Sent by the server in response to the user’s request.

 - Start line: tells you what kind of message is being sent-whether it is a request or a response
 - Headers: Made up of key value pairs that provide extra info about the HTTP message. Give instructions for both client and server
 - Empty line: Divider between header and body
 - Body: Where the actual data is stored

## HTTP Request: Request Line and Methods

HTTP request is what a user sends to a web server to interact with a web application and make something happen. 

#### Request line

The request line is the first part of an HTTP request and tells the server what kind of request its dealing with. It has three main parts the **HTTP method**, the **URL path**, and the **HTTP version**.

Example: <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">METHOD /path HTTP/version</mark>

#### HTTP Methods

[[../1. Pre Security/2. How The Web Works##HTTP Methods |HTTP Methods]]

#### URL Path

The URL path tells the server where to find a resource the user is asking for

Attackers often try to manipulate the URL path to exploit vulnerabilities so it is important to: 

- Validate the URL path
- Sanitize the path to avoid injection attacks
- Protect sensitive data by conducting privacy and risk assessments

#### HTTP Version

**HTTP/1.1** (1997) persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, and better caching. Widely used today.

**HTTP/2** (2015)Introduced features like multiplexing, header compression, and prioritization for faster performance.

**HTTP/3** (2022)Built on HTTP/2, but uses a new protocol (QUIC) for quicker and more secure connections.

 HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 offer better speed and security, many systems still use **HTTP/1.1** because it’s well-supported and works with most existing setups. Upgrading to HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 can provide significant performance and security improvements


## HTTP Request: Headers and Body

[[../1. Pre Security/2. How The Web Works#Common Request Headers| Request Headers]]

#### Request Body

In HTTP requests such as POST and PUT, the data is located inside the HTTP Request Body. The formatting of the data can take many forms but the most common ones include:

- URL Encoded (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) ;; data is structure in key pairs and values. Multiple pairs are separated by  (&).
<!--SR:!2025-04-15,23,189-->

```http
POST /profile HTTP/1.1
Host: tryhackme.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 33

name=Aleksandra&age=27&country=US
```

- Form Data (multipart/form-data) ;; allows multiple data blocks to be sent where each block is separated by a boundary string. The boundary string is the defined header of the request itself
<!--SR:!2025-04-14,15,169-->

```http
POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Host: tryhackme.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW

----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="username"

aleksandra
----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="profile_pic"; filename="aleksandra.jpg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

[Binary Data Here representing the image]
----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW--
```

- JSON (application/json) ;; formatted in pairs of name : value
<!--SR:!2025-04-06,14,209-->

```http
POST /api/user HTTP/1.1
Host: tryhackme.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 62

{
    "name": "Aleksandra",
    "age": 27,
    "country": "US"
}
```

XML (application/xml) ;; data is structured inside labels called tags, which have an opening and closing.
<!--SR:!2025-04-11,31,209-->

```http
POST /api/user HTTP/1.1
Host: tryhackme.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Content-Type: application/xml
Content-Length: 124

<user>
    <name>Aleksandra</name>
    <age>27</age>
    <country>US</country>
</user>
```

## HTTP Response: Status Line and Status Code

#### Status Line
The first line in every HTTP response is called the Status Line. It gives you three key pieces on info:
1. HTTP Version: tells you which version of HTTP is being used
2. Status Code: A three-digit number showing the outcome of your request
3. Reason Phrase: short message explaining the status code in human readable terms

#### Status Codes and Reason Phrases

[[../1. Pre Security/2. How The Web Works#HTTP Status Codes| Status Codes]]

## HTTP Response: Headers and Body

When a web server responds to an HTTP request, it includes HTTP response headers. These headers provide important info about the response and tell the client how to handle it. 

[[../1. Pre Security/2. How The Web Works#Common Response Headers| Response Headers]]


## Security Headers

HTTP Security Headers help improve the overall security of web applications by providing mitigations against attacks lie XSS, clickjacking and others. 

#### Content Security Policy
?
Header that is an additional security layer that can help mitigate against common attacks such as XSS. CSP provides a way for administrators to say what domain and sources are considered safe.
<!--SR:!2025-04-09,20,169--> 

Looking at an example CSP header:

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://cdn.tryhackme.com; style-src 'self'
default-src</mark>

- **default-src**
	- specifies the default policy of self, which means only the current website.

- **script-src**
	-  specifics the policy for where scripts can be loaded from, which is self along with scripts hosted 

- **style-src**
	-  specifies the policy for where style CSS style sheets can be loaded from the current website (self)

#### Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
?
Ensures web browsers will always connect over HTTPS
<!--SR:!2025-04-04,33,229-->

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload</mark>

- max-age
	-  expiry time in seconds

- includeSubDomains
	-  optional setting that instructs the browser to also apply this setting to all subdomains.

- preload
	-  optional setting that allows the website to be included in preload lists. Browsers can use preload lists to enforce HSTS before even having their first visit to a website.


#### X-Content-Type-Options
?
Instruct browsers not to guess the MIME time of a resource but only use the Content-Type header
<!--SR:!2025-04-09,13,189-->

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</mark>


- nosniff
	- This directive instructs the browser not to sniff or guess the MIME type.

#### Referrer-Policy
?
Controls the amount of information sent to the destination web server when a user is redirected from the source web server.
<!--SR:!2025-04-03,4,130--> 


- **no-referrer**  
    -  completely disables any information being sent about the referrer  
  
- **same-origin**  
    - only sends referrer information when the destination is part of the same origin. This is helpful when you want referrer information passed when hyperlinks are within the same website but not outside to external websites.  

- **strict-origin**  
    -  only sends the referrer as the origin when the protocol stays the same. 

- **strict-origin-when-cross-origin**  
    -  similar to strict-origin except for same-origin requests, where it sends the full URL path in the origin header.

# JavaScript Essentials 

## Essential Concepts

Variables are containers that allow you to store data values in them. There are three ways to declare a variable in JS:

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">var</mark>
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">let</mark>
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">const</mark>

#### Data Types

Data types define the type of value a variable can hold. Examples include:

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">string</mark> 
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">number</mark>
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">boolean</mark>

#### Functions

Represents a block of code designed to perform a specific task

#### Loops

Allow you to run a block of code multiple times as long as a condition is true

## JavaScript Overview

JS is an ==interpreted language, meaning the code is executed directly in the browser without prior compilation==
<!--SR:!2025-04-13,14,149-->

JS is executed on the client side, which makes it easy to inspect and interact with HTML directly within the browser

## Integrating JavaScript in HTML

Usually JS is not used to render content; it works with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and interactive web pages. 

#### Internal JavaScript

Embedding the JS code directly within an HTML document with the \<script> tag

#### External JavaScript

Creating and storing JS code in separate file ending with a .js file extension. This file can be stored and hosted on the same web server as the HTML document or stored on an external web server such as the cloud. 

This approach allows us to keep the JS code separate from the HTML, making the code more organized and easier to maintain, especially when working on larger projects.

#### Verifying Internal or External JS

When pen-testing a web application, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">it is important to check whether the website uses internal or external JS</span>. This can be easily done by viewing the pages source code. 

If you see a \<script> tag with a **src** attribute, it indicates that the page is loading external JS from a separate file.

## Abusing Dialogue Functions

One of the main objectives of JS is to provide dialogue boxes for interaction with users and dynamically update content on web pages. JS provides functions such as <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">alert</mark>, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">prompt</mark>, and <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">confirm</mark> to facilitate this interaction.

#### Alert

The alert function displays a message in a dialogue box with an "<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">OK</mark>" button, typically used to convey information or warnings to users

#### Prompt

displays a dialogue box that asks the user for input. It returns the entered value when the user clicks "<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">OK</mark>", or null if the user clicks "<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Cancel</mark>"

#### Confirm

displays a dialogue box with a message and two buttons: "<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">OK</mark>" and "<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Cancel</mark>". It returns true if the user clicks "OK" and false if the user clicks "Cancel".

#### How Hackers Exploit the Functionality

Imagine receiving an email from a stranger with an attached HTML file. The file looks harmless, but when you open it, it contains JS that disrupts your browsing experience.


``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Hacked</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script>
        for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            alert("Hacked");
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Bypassing Control Flow Statements

Control flow refers to the order in which statements and code blocks are executed based on certain conditions. 

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">if-else</mark>
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">switch</mark>
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">for</mark> 
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">while</mark>
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">do...while</mark>

## Exploring Minified Filters

Minification ;; the process of compressing JS files by removing all unnecessary characters such as spaces, line breaks, comments, and even shortening variable names. Helps reduce file size.
<!--SR:!2025-04-26,34,201-->

Obfuscation ;; used to make code harder to understand by adding undesired code, renaming variables, and even inserting dummy code
<!--SR:!2025-08-01,124,281-->

## Best Practices

#### Avoid using client side validation only

Users can disable and manipulate JS on the client side. Performing server side validation is also essential

#### Refrain from adding untrusted libraries

Bad actors upload bundles of libraries on the internet with names resembling legitimate ones. 

#### Avoid Hardcoded Secrets

Never Hardcode sensitive API keys, access tokens, or credentials into your codes

#### Minify and Obfuscate Your JS Code

Reduces its size and load time and makes it harder to understand the logic of the code. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Always minify and obfuscate the code when using code in production</span>. The attacker can reverse engineer it, but getting the original code will at least take some effort

# SQL Fundamentals

## Databases 101

Databases are  ==organized collection of structured information or data that is easily accessible and can be manipulated or analyzed.== The data can take many forms such as user authentication data, user generated data on social media, as well as information such as watch history
<!--SR:!2025-04-02,13,181--> 

## Different Types of Databases

**Relational databases** ;; store structured data, meaning the data inserted into this database follows a structure. For example, the data collected on a user consists of first_name, last_name, email_address, username and password. When a new user joins, an entry is made in the database following this structure. This structured data is stored in rows and columns in a table
<!--SR:!2025-06-06,78,249-->

**Non-relational database** ;; data is stored in a non-tabular format. For example, if a document is being scanned which contains various types and quantities of information
<!--SR:!2025-04-13,42,249-->

The type of database you choose depends on the context in which the database will be used. Relational is often used when the data being stored is reliably going to be received in a consistent format where accuracy is important, such as processing e-commerce transactions. Non-relational is better when data being received can vary greatly in its format but needs to be collected an organized in the same place, such as social media platforms

####  Tables, Rows and Columns

All data stored in a relational database will be stored in a table. Below is an example of a collection of books

![[../../attachments/DB Table Example.png]]
When creating this table, you need to define what pieces of information are needed to define a book record. For example, example, “id”, “Name”, and “Published_date”. These would be your columns. If an attempt is made to insert a record into a database where the data type doesn't match, it is rejected. The data types that can be defined can vary depending on what database you are using, but the core data types used by all include Strings (a collection of words and characters), Integers (numbers), floats/decimals (numbers with a decimal point) and Times/Dates.

#### Primary and Foreign Keys

Once a table has been defined and populated, more data needs to be stored.  For instance, we want to create a table named “Authors” that stores the authors of the books sold in the store. A book (stored in the Books table) is written by an author (stored in the Authors table). If we wanted to query for a book in our story but also have the author of that book returned, our data would need to be related somehow; we do this with keys. There are two types of keys:

![[../../attachments/Primary and Foreign Keys.png]]

**Primary Keys** ;; A primary key is used to ensure that the data collected in a certain column is unique. There needs to be a way to uniquely identify each record in a table. ID would make the most sense in the example as an ID has been uniquely created for each book. <u>There can only be one primary key </u>
<!--SR:!2025-08-19,142,289-->

Foreign Keys ;; A column that also exists in another table within the database and therefore provides a link between the two tables. The “author_id” field in our “Books” would act as a foreign key because the author_id in our Books table corresponds to the “id” column in the author table. Foreign keys are what allow the relationships between different tables in relational databases. <u>There can be more than one foreign key</u>
<!--SR:!2025-05-01,42,209-->

## SQL

Databases are usually controlled using a Database Management System (DBMS). Serving as an interface between the end user and database, a DBMS is a software program that allows users to retrieve, update, and manage the data being stored (MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle Database and Maria DB)

The structure between the end user and the database can be done using SQL. SQL is ==a programming language that can be used to query, define and manipulate data stored in a relational database==
<!--SR:!2025-04-28,48,229-->

#### The Benefits of SQL and Relational Databases

- Its fast
- Easy to learn
- Reliable
- Flexible

## Database and Table Statements

#### Database Statements

CREATE DATABASE {database_name}
SHOW DATABASES {database_name}
USE {database_name}
DROP database {database_name} - removes database

#### Table Statements

CREATE TABLE {table_name}

``` mysql

mysql> CREATE TABLE book_inventory ( 
book_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, 
book_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, 
publication_date DATE

```


- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">AUTO_INCREMENT</mark> means the first book inserted would be assigned <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">book_id</mark> 1, the second book inserted would be assigned a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">book_id</mark> of 2, and so on
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">book_id</mark> is set as the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">PRIMARY KEY</mark> as it will be the way we uniquely identify a book record in our table
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">VARCHAR(255)</mark> means it can variable characters and has a limit of 255, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">NOT NULL</mark> means it cannot be empty
- Publication_date is set as the data type <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">DATE</mark>

- SHOW TABLES {table_name}
- DESCRIBE {table_name} - what columns are contained within a table
- DROP {table_name} - removes table
- ALTER {table_name} - if you need to change a dataset

```mysql
ALTER TABLE book_inventory ADD page_count INT; -- would add  a coulmn

```


## CRUD Operations

 CRUD stands for ;;  Create, Read, Update, and Delete which are considered the basic operations in any system that manages data
<!--SR:!2025-04-01,2,185-->

Create Operations (INSERT) - create new records in a table
``` mysql
INSERT INTO books (id, name, published_date, description) VALUES (1, "Android Security Internals", "2014-10-14", "An In-Depth Guide to Android's Security Architecture");

```

Read Operations (SELECT) - read or retrieves info from a table
```mysql
SELECT * FROM books; -- select all columns
SELECT name, description FROM books; -- select certain columns 
```

Update Operation (UPDATE) - modifies and existing record within a table. UPDATE specifies the table, SET followed by the column name you will update. WHERE specifies which row to update when the clause is met
```mysql
UPDATE books 
SET description = "An In-Depth Guide to Android's Security Architecture." WHERE id = 1;
```

Delete Operations (DELETE) - removes record from table

``` mysql
DELETE FROM books WHERE id = 1;

```

## Clauses

A clause is part of a statement that specifies the criteria of the data being manipulated, usually by an initial statement

- DISTINCT  - used to avoid duplicate records when doing  a query, only returning unique values
``` mysql
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM books;
```

- GROUP BY - aggregates data from multiple records and groups the query results in common
``` mysql
SELECT name, COUNT(*) 
FROM books 
GROUP BY name;
```

- ORDER BY - sorts the records returned by a query in ascending or descending order using <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">ASC</mark> or <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">DESC</mark>
``` mysql
SELECT * 
FROM books 
ORDER BY published_date ASC;
```

- HAVING - used with other clauses to filter groups or results of records based on a condition, filters after the aggregation is done
``` mysql
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM books;
```


## Operators

#### Logical Operators
LIKE - commonly used in conjunction with the WHERE clause in order to filter for a specific pattern within a columns

``` mysql
SELECT * 
FROM books 
WHERE description LIKE "%guide%";

```

- AND - multiple conditions within a query and returns TRUE if all of them are true
- OR - multiple conditions within a query and returns TRUE if one of them are true
- NOT - reverses the value of  a boolean operator
- BETWEEN - tests if values exists within a defined range

#### Comparison Operators
- = - compares two expressions and determines if they are equal or it can check if a value matches another in one specific column
- != - compares expressions and tests if they are not equal; it also checks if a value differs from the one within a column.
- < - less than 
- \> - greater than
- <= - less than or equal to
- \>= - greater than or equal to

## Functions

#### String Functions

CONCAT() - adds two or more strings together. It is useful for combining text from different columns. The below query concatenates the name and category columns from the books table into a single one named book_info.
``` mysql
SELECT CONCAT(name, " is a type of ", category, " book.") AS book_info FROM books;
```


GROUP_CONCAT() - concatenates data from multiple rows into one field. The query below groups the books by category and concatenates the titles of books within each category into a single string.
``` mysql
SELECT category, GROUP_CONCAT(name SEPARATOR ", ") AS books 
FROM books 
GROUP BY category;
```

SUBSTRING() - retrieve a substring from a string within a query, starting at a determined position. The query above extracts the first four characters from the published_date column and stores them in the published_year column

``` mysql
SELECT SUBSTRING(published_date, 1, 4) AS published_year FROM books;
```


LENGTH() - returns the number of characters in a string


#### Aggregate Functions

COUNT() - returns the number of records within an expression
SUM() - sums all values
MAX() - maximum value within a provided column
MIN() Function - minimum value within a provided column
