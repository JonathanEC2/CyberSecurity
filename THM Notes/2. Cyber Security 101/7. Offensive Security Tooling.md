# Hydra

## Hydra Introduction

Hydra is a brute force online password cracking program. Hydra can run through a "brute force" some authentication services 
## Using Hydra 

The options that we pass into hydra depend on what service (protocol) we're attacking. For example, if we wanted to brute force FTP with the username being <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">user</mark> and a passwords list being passlist.txt, we'd use the following command

<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">hydra</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">-l</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">user</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">-P</span> passlist.txt ftp://10.10.245.6

| Option | Description                            |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| -l     | specifies the (SSH) username for login |
| -P     | indicates a list of passwords          |
| -t     | sets the number of threads to spawn    |

<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">hydra</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">-l</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">user</span> <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">-P</span> passwords.txt 10.10.9.229 -t 4 ssh
- Hydra will use <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">root</mark> as the username for <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">ssh</mark>
- It will try the passwords in the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">passwords.txt</mark> file
- There will be four threads running in parallel as indicated by <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-t 4</mark>

#### Post Web Form

We can use Hydra to brute force web forms too. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">You must know which type of request it is making</span>; GET or POST methods are commonly used. You can use your browser’s network tab (in developer tools) to see the request types or view the source code.

| {http-post-form}                               | the type of the form is POST                                                                                                       |
| {path}                                         | the login page URL, for example, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">login.php</mark>                                             |
| {login_credentials}                            | the username and password used to log in, for example, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">username=^USER^&password=^PASS^</mark> |
| {invalid_response}                             | part of the response when the login fails                                                                                          |
| <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">-V</span> | verbose output for every attempt                                                                                                   |

```
hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> 10.10.9.229 http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V
```

- The login page is only /, i.e., the main IP address.
- The username is the form field where the username is entered
- The specified username(s) will replace ^USER^
- The password is the form field where the password is entered
- The provided passwords will be replacing ^PASS^
- Finally, F=incorrect is a string that appears in the server reply when the login fails

# Gobuster: The Basics

## Gobuster Introduction

Gobuster enumerates web directories, DNS subdomains, vhosts, Amazon S3 buckets, and Google Cloud Storage by brute force, using specific wordlists. 

Enumeration ;; is the act of listing all available resources, whether they are accessible or not

Brute Force is the act of trying every possibility until a match is found

## Use Case: Directory and File Enumeration

Gobuster has a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">dir</mark> mode that allows users to  enumerate website directories and their files. This is most useful when performing a pentest and would like to see what the directory structure of a website is and what files it contains

Gobuster is powerful because it tells you the stats codes of the website which immediately tell you if you, as an outsider, can request that directory or not

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">gobuster dir --help
</mark>

```
gobuster dir -u "http://www.example.thm" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -r
```

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">gobuster dir</mark> configures gobuster to use directory and file enumeration mode
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-u http://www.example.thm</mark>
	- Explains where Gobuster starts looking
	- The URL must contain the protocol used. This is important and required.
	- In the host part of the URL, you can fill in a host name or an IP. However, you may get a different website than you intend using IP because a webserver can host multiple websites using onw IP (virtual hosting). Use hostname if  you want to be sure
	- Gobuster does not enumerate recursively, so if you are interested in a directory path, you will have to enumerate that specific directory
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt</mark> configures Gobuster to use the *directory-list-2.3-medium.txt* wordlist to enumerate
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-r </mark>configures Gobuster to follow the redirect responses received from the sent request


## Use Case: Subdomain Enumeration

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">dns</mark> mode allows use to brute force subdomains. During a pentest, checking the subdomain is important. Just because something is patched in the regular domain doesn't mean it is also patched in the subdomain.


<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">gobuster dns --help</mark>


```
gobuster dns -d example.thm -w /path/to/wordlist
```

## Use Case: Vhost Enumeration

vhost allows gobuster to brute force virtual hosts. Virtual hosts are different websites on the same machine. Sometimes they look like subdomains. Virtual hosts are IP-based and running on the same server. Subdomains are set up in DNS. 

```
gobuster vhost -u "http://10.10.125.193" --domain example.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt --append-domain --exclude-length 250-320
```

*www.example.thm*

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">www</mark>  This is the subdomain. This is the part that Gobuster will fill in with each entry of the configured wordlist.



- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">gobuster vhost</mark> instructs Gobuster to enumerate virtual hosts.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-u "http://10.10.125.193" </mark>sets the URL to browse to 10.10.125.193.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.tx</mark>t configures Gobuster to use the *subdomains-top1million-5000.txt wordlist*
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-domain example.thm</mark> sets the top- and second-level domains
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">--append-domain</mark> appends the configured domain to each entry in the wordlist. If this flag is not configured, the set hostname would be www, blog, etc. This will cause the command to work incorrectly and display false positives.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">--exclude-length</mark> filters the responses we get from the sent web requests. With this flag, we can filter out the false positives. These false positives typically have a similar response size, so we can use this to filter out most false positives.

# Shells Overview

# SQLMap: The Basics

A database is a collection of data that can be stored, modified, and retrieved. It stores data from several applications in a structured format, making storage, modification, and retrieval easy and efficient. Websites have databases that store the users information. So when you enter your credentials to a websites login page, the website interacts with the database to see if these credentials are correct. The databases are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or Microsoft SQL Server.

Let’s assume the website login page we discussed above lacks input validation and sanitization. This means that it is vulnerable to SQL injection. The attacker does not know the password of the user John. They will type the following input in the given fields:

``` mysql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'John' AND password = 'abc' OR 1=1;-- -';
```

This query will check if there is a user John, and then check if he has the password abc. Ideally, the query should fail here because it expects both username and password to be correct, as the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">AND</mark> operator is between them. This query, however, has another condition <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">OR 1=1</mark>.  Any one of them being true will make the whole SQL query successful. The password failed, so the query will check the next condition, which checks if 1=1. As we know, 1=1 is always true, so it will ignore the random password entered before this and consider this statement as true, which will successfully execute this query. The<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;"> -- - </mark>at the end of the query would comment anything after 1=1, which means the query would be successfully executed, and the attacker would get logged in to John’s user account.

One of the important things to note here is the use of a single quote <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">'</mark> after <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">abc</mark>. Without this single quote,' the whole string <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">'abc OR 1=1;-- -'</mark> would be considered the password, which is not intended. However, if we add a single quote ' after abc, the password would look like 'abc' OR 1=1;---', which encloses the original string abc in the query and allows us to introduce a logical condition<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;"> OR 1=1</mark>, which is always true.
