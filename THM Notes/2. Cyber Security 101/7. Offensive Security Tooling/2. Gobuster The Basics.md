## Gobuster Introduction

Gobuster enumerates web directories, DNS subdomains, vhosts, Amazon S3 buckets, and Google Cloud Storage by brute force, using specific wordlists. 

Enumeration ;; is the act of listing all available resources, whether they are accessible or not

Brute Force is the act of trying every possibility until a match is found

## Use Case: Directory and File Enumeration

Gobuster has a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">dir</mark> mode that allows users to enumerate website directories and their files. This is most useful when performing a pentest and would like to see what the directory structure of a website is and what files it contains

Gobuster is powerful because it tells you the stats codes of the website which immediately tell you if you, as an outsider, can request that directory or not

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">gobuster dir --help
</mark>

```
gobuster dir -u "http://www.example.thm" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -r
```

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">gobuster dir</mark> configures gobuster to use directory and file enumeration mode
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-u http://www.example.thm</mark>
	- Explains where Gobuster starts looking
	- The URL must contain the protocol used. This is important and required.
	- In the host part of the URL, you can fill in a host name or an IP. However, you may get a different website than you intend using IP because a webserver can host multiple websites using onw IP (virtual hosting). Use hostname if  you want to be sure
	- Gobuster does not enumerate recursively, so if you are interested in a directory path, you will have to enumerate that specific directory
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt</mark> configures Gobuster to use the *directory-list-2.3-medium.txt* wordlist to enumerate
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-r </mark>configures Gobuster to follow the redirect responses received from the sent request


## Use Case: Subdomain Enumeration

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">dns</mark> mode allows use to brute force subdomains. During a pentest, checking the subdomain is important. Just because something is patched in the regular domain doesn't mean it is also patched in the subdomain.


<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">gobuster dns --help</mark>


```
gobuster dns -d example.thm -w /path/to/wordlist
```

## Use Case: Vhost Enumeration

vhost allows gobuster to brute force virtual hosts. Virtual hosts are different websites on the same machine. Sometimes they look like subdomains. Virtual hosts are IP-based and running on the same server. Subdomains are set up in DNS. 

```
gobuster vhost -u "http://10.10.125.193" --domain example.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt --append-domain --exclude-length 250-320
```

*www.example.thm*

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">www</mark>  This is the subdomain. This is the part that Gobuster will fill in with each entry of the configured wordlist.



- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">gobuster vhost</mark> instructs Gobuster to enumerate virtual hosts.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-u "http://10.10.125.193" </mark>sets the URL to browse to 10.10.125.193.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt</mark> configures Gobuster to use the *subdomains-top1million-5000.txt wordlist*
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">-domain example.thm</mark> sets the top- and second-level domains
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">--append-domain</mark> appends the configured domain to each entry in the wordlist. If this flag is not configured, the set hostname would be www, blog, etc. This will cause the command to work incorrectly and display false positives.
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">--exclude-length</mark> filters the responses we get from the sent web requests. With this flag, we can filter out the false positives. These false positives typically have a similar response size, so we can use this to filter out most false positives.
