# Incident Response Fundamentals

## Introduction to Incident Response

Incident Response handles an incident from its start to end. From deploying security in several areas to prevent incidents to fighting with them, and minimizing their impact, incident response is a thorough guideline.

## What are Incidents?

Some processes are interactive meaning you performed the actions. There are also noninteractive processes running in the background that may not require your interaction with them. Both are necessary for your device. Both log events for anything they do. 

The alerts that point to something dangerous but are not harmful are referred to as **false positives**. In contrast, the alerts that point to something harmful and are actually dangerous are called **true positives**. These true positive alerts are sometimes referred to as **Incidents**.  After the alert is categorized as an incident, the next phase is to give a severity level to the incident.

## Types of Incidents

**Malware Infections**: Malware is a malicious program that can damage a system, network, or application. The majority of incidents are associated with malware infections.
**Security Breaches:** Security Breaches arise when an unauthorized person gets access to confidential data (something we don’t want them to see or have).
**Data Leaks:** Data leaks are incidents in which confidential information of an individual or an organization is exposed to unauthorized entities. Many attackers use data leaks for reputational damage to their victims or to threaten their victims and get what they need from them.
**Insider Attacks:** Incidents from within an organization are known as insider attacks.
**Denial Of Service Attacks:** Denial of Service attacks, or DoS attacks, are incidents where the attacker floods a system/network/application with false requests, eventually making it unavailable to legitimate users.

## Incident Response Techniques

There are multiple security solutions that serve their own unique roles in detecting any incidents. Some of them even have the capability to respond to the incidents and execute the other phases of the lifecycle, such as containment, eradication, etc:

- **SIEM**: collects all important logs in one centralized location and correlates them to identify incidents
- **AV**: detects known malicious programs in a system and regularly scans your system for them
- **EDR**: Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is deployed on every system, protecting it against some advanced-level threats. This solution can also contain and eradicate the threat.

Playbooks: Step-by-step comprehensive guidelines for incident response  including investigating the extent of the attack, taking necessary actions to prevent further damage and eliminating it from the root. These steps may be different for different kinds of incidents.
