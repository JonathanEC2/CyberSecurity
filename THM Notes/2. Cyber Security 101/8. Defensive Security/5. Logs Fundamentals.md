# Logs Fundamentals

There are various places inside a system where the traces of an attack could be fetched. The logs contain most of these traces. Logs are the digital footprints left behind by any activity.

## Types of Logs

Logs are segregated into multiple categories according to the type of information that they provide. 

| Log Type         | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                            | Example                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| System Logs      | The system logs can be helpful in troubleshooting running issues in the OS. These logs provide information on various operating system activities.                                               | - System Startup and shutdown events  <br>- Driver Loading events  <br>- System Error events  <br>- Hardware events                                    |
| Security Logs    | The security logs help detect and investigate incidents. These logs provide information on the security-related activities in the system.                                                        | -Authentication events  <br>- Authorization events  <br>- Security Policy changes events  <br>- User Account changes events - Abnormal Activity events |
| Application Logs | The application logs contain specific events related to the application. Any interactive or non-interactive activity happening inside the application will be logged here.                       | - User Interaction events  <br>- Application Changes events  <br>- Application Update events <br>- Application Error events                            |
| Audit Logs       | The Audit logs provide detailed information on the system changes and user events. These logs are helpful for compliance requirements and can play a vital role in security monitoring as well.  | - Data Access events  <br>- System Change events  <br>- User Activity events  <br>- Policy Enforcement events                                          |
| Network Logs     | Network logs provide information on the network’s outgoing and incoming traffic. They play crucial roles in troubleshooting network issues and can also be handy during incident investigations. | - Incoming Network Traffic events  <br>- Outgoing Network Traffic events  <br>- Network Connection Logs - Network Firewall Logs                        |
| Access Logs      | The Access logs provide detailed information about the access to different resources. These resources can be of different types, providing us with information on their access.                  | - Webserver Access Logs  <br>- Database Access Logs - Application Access Logs  <br>- API Access Logs                                                   |

Log Analysis is a technique for extracting valuable data from logs. It involves looking for any signs of abnormal or unusual activities.

## Windows Event Logs Analysis

Numerous event IDs are available in Windows event logs. We can use these event IDs to search for any specific activity. 

4624	A user account successfully logged in
4625	A user account failed to login
4634	A user account successfully logged off
4720	A user account was created
4724	An attempt was made to reset an account’s password
4722	A user account was enabled
4725	A user account was disabled
4726	A user account was deleted

  
## Web Server Access Logs Analysis

All  requests are logged by the website and stored in a log file on the web server running that website.

We can use the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">cat</span> command to display the contents of a log file, as they are typically in the text format.

```
cat access.log
```

Most systems rotate the logs regularly. This rotation helps them create individual log files for specific timeframes and not carry them all in a single log file. We can combine the results of multiple files within one single file, as shown below.

```
cat access1.log access2.log > combined_access.log
```

<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">grep</span> is useful for searching for strings and patterns inside a log file.

The <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">less</span> command is helpful for handling multiple log files. Use <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">spacebar</mark> to move to the next page and <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">b</mark> to the previous page.  If you wish to search for something in the logs, you can type <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">/ </mark>followed by the pattern you are searching for and hit enter.
