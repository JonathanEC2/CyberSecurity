# Defensive Security Intro

Defensive Security is concerned with two main tasks:
?
1. Preventing intrusions from occurring
2. Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly
<!--SR:!2025-04-24,9,190--> 

Some tasks that are related to defensive security include:
- User cyber security awareness
- Documenting and managing assets
- Updating and patching systems
- Setting up preventative security devices
- Setting up logging and monitoring devices

## Areas of Defensive Security

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a ==team of cyber security specialists that monitor the networks and its systems to detect malicious cyber events.== Some main areas of interest for a SOC are:
<!--SR:!2025-05-07,14,190-->

- Vulnerabilities
- Policy violations
- Unauthorized activity
- Network intrusion
### Threat Intelligence

Intelligence refers to information you gather about actual and potential enemies. A threat is any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system. Threat intelligence collects information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries. The purpose would be to achieve a *threat-informed defense*.

### Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

#### Digital Forensics

In defensive security, the focus on digital forensics shifts to analyzing evidence of an attack and its perpetrators and other areas such as intellectual property theft, cyber espionage, and possession of unauthorized content. Digital forensics focuses on other areas, such as:

- File System: Analyzing a digital forensics image (low-level copy) of a system’s storage reveals a lot of information, such as installed programs, created files, etc.
- System memory: taking a forensic image (low-level copy) of the system memory after a malicious program is ran
- System logs: Log files provide plenty of information about what happened on a system. Even if the attacker tries to clear their traces, some traces will remain.
- Network logs: Logs of the network packets that have traversed a network would help answer more questions about whether an attack is occurring and what it entails.

#### Incident Response

An incident usually refers to a data breach or cyber attack; however, in some cases, it can be something less critical, such as a misconfiguration, an intrusion attempt, or a policy violation. The four major phases of the incident response process are:

1. Preparation
2. Detection
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
4. Post-Incident Activity

### Malware Analysis

Malware stands for malicious software. Software refers to programs, documents, and files you can save on a disk or send over the network.

- A virus is a piece of code (part of a program) that attaches itself to a program. It is designed to spread from one computer to another and works by altering, overwriting, and deleting files once it infects a computer.
- Trojan Horse is a program that shows one desirable function but hides a malicious function underneath.
- Ransomware is a malicious program that encrypts the user’s files. The attacker offers the user the encryption password if the user is willing to pay a ransom.

# SOC Fundamentals

A Security Operations enter is a dedicated facility operated by a specialized security team. This team works 24 hours a day, seven days a week

## Purpose and Components

The main focus of the SOC is to keep **detection** and **response** in tact. Continuous monitoring is required to detect and respond to any security incident

#### Detection

- **Detect vulnerabilities**: a vulnerability is a weakness in a system that an attacker can exploit to carry out things beyond their permission level. Vulnerabilities are not necessarily the SOCs responsibility; however, unfixed vulnerabilities affect the security level of the entire company
- **Detect unauthorized activity**: example would be a user logging in from a suspicious location
- **Detect policy violations**: A security policy is a set of rules and procedures created to help protect a company against security threats and ensure compliance
- **Detect intrusions**: intrusions refer to unauthorized access to systems and networks

#### Response

**Support with the incident response**: Once an incident is detected, certain steps are taken to respond to it. This response includes minimizing its impact and performing the root cause analysis of the incident

The three pillars of a SOC are People, Process, and Technology

## People

Roles and responsibilities of SOC team


- **SOC Analyst (Level 1):** Anything detected by the security solution would pass through these analysts first. These are the first responders to any detection. SOC Level 1 Analysts perform basic alert triage to determine if a specific detection is harmful. They also report these detections through proper channels.
- **SOC Analyst (Level 2):**  Level 2 Analysts  dive deeper into the investigations and correlate the data from multiple data sources to perform a proper analysis.
- **SOC Analyst (Level 3):** Level 3 Analysts are experienced professionals who proactively look for any threat indicators and support in the incident response activities. The critical severity detection reported by Level 1 and Level 2 Analysts are often security incidents that need detailed responses, including containment, eradication, and recovery. This is where Level 3 analysts’ experience comes in handy.
- **Security Engineer**: All analysts work on security solutions. These solutions need deployment and configuration. Security Engineers deploy and configure these security solutions to ensure their smooth operation.
- **Detection Engineer**: Security rules are the logic built behind security solutions to detect harmful activities. Level 2 and 3 Analysts often create these rules, while the SOC team can sometimes also utilize the detection engineer role independently for this responsibility.
- **SOC Manager**: The SOC Manager manages the processes the SOC team follows and provides support. The SOC Manager also remains in contact with the organization’s CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) to provide him with updates on the SOC team’s current security posture and efforts.

## Process

Each role has its own process,  just as we saw the role of Level 1 SOC Analysts as the first responders to carry out alert triage and determine if it is harmful. 

#### Alert Triage

The alert triage is the basis of the SOC team. The first response to any alert is to perform the triage. This helps determine the severity of the alert and helps us prioritize it. The triage is all about answering the 5 W's:
- Who 
- What 
- Where 
- When
- Why

The detected harmful alerts need to be escalated to higher level analysts for a timely response and resolution. These alerts are escalated as tickets and assigned to relevant people. 

## Technology

This refers to the security solutions. These solutions efficiently minimize the SOC teams manual effort to detect and respond to threats. Security solutions centralize all the information of the device or applications present in the network and automate the detection and response capabilities

**SIEM**: Security Information and Event Management is a popular tool used by every SOC environment. It collects logs form various network devices, referred to as source logs. Detection rules are configured in the SIEM solution which contains logic to identify suspicious activity.  The SIEM solution provides us with the detections after correlating them with multiple log sources and alerts us in case of a match with any of the rules

**EDR**;; Endpoint Detection and Response provides the SOC with real time and historical visibility of the devices' activities. EDR has extensive detection capabilities for endpoints, allowing you to investigate them in detail and respond with a few clicks.
<!--SR:!2025-04-25,10,170-->

**Firewall**: functions purely for network security and acts as a barrier between your internal and external networks.  It monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and filters any unauthorized traffic. The firewall also has some detection rules deployed, which help us identify and block suspicious traffic before it reaches the internal network.

# Digital Forensics Fundamentals

The branch of forensics that investigates cyber crimes is known as **digital forensics**. **Cyber crime** is any criminal activity conducted on or using a digital device.

## Digital Forensics Methodology

The NIST defines a general process of digital forensics in four phases

- **Collection**: Identifying all the devices from which the data can be collected is essential. It is necessary to ensure the data is not  tampered with while collecting the evidence and to maintain a proper document containing the collected items details
- **Examination**: Usually data needs to be filtered and the data of interest needs to be extracted. 
- **Analysis**: This is a critical phase. The investigators now have to analyze the data by correlating it with multiple pieces of evidence to draw conclusions. The analysis aims to extract activities relevant to the case chronologically. 
- **Reporting**: The report contains the investigation methodology and detailed findings from the collected evidence. It may also contain recommendations. This report is presented to law enforcement and executive management. 

Common types of digital forensics
- Computer forensics
- Mobile forensics
- Network forensics
- Database forensics
- Cloud forensics
- Email forensics

## Evidence Acquisition

#### Proper Authorization

The forensics team should obtain proper authorization from relevant authorities before collecting any data. Evidence without prior approval may be inadmissible in court. 

#### Chain of Custody

A chain of custody is a formal document containing all the details of the evidence. Some of the key details are:

- Description of the evidence
- Name and individual who collected the evidence
- Date and time of evidence collection
- Storage location of each piece of evidence
- Access times and the individual record who accessed the evidence

This creates a proper trail of evidence and helps preserve it. 

#### Use of write blockers

Integral part of a forensics teams toolbox. Makes sure devices stay in their original state as the write blocker can block any evidence alteration actions

## Windows Forensics

The most common type of evidence collected from crime scenes are desktop computers and laptops. 

As part of the data collection phase, forensic images of the windows system are taken. These images are bit-by-bit copies of the whole operating system. Two different categories of forensic images are taken from a Windows OS

- Disk image: this contains all the data present on the storage device of the system (HDD,SSD.etc.) This data is non-volatile
- Memory image: this contains the data inside the operating systems RAM. This memory is volatile. To capture open files, running processes, current network connections, etc., the memory image should be prioritized and taken first from the suspect’s operating system; otherwise, any restart or shutdown of the system would result in all the volatile data getting deleted.

Popular tools used for disk and memory image acquisition and analysis of the Windows operating system.

**<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">FTK Imager</span>:** FTK Imager is a widely used tool for taking disk images of Windows operating systems. It offers a user-friendly graphical interface for creating the image in various formats.
**<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Autopsy</span>:** [Autopsy](https://www.autopsy.com/) is a popular open-source digital forensics platform. An investigator can import an acquired disk image into this tool, and the tool will conduct an extensive analysis of the image.
**<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">DumpIt</span>:** [DumpIt](https://www.toolwar.com/2014/01/dumpit-memory-dump-tools.html) offers the utility of taking a memory image from a Windows operating system. This tool creates memory images using a command-line interface and a few commands.
**<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Volatility</span>:** [Volatility](https://volatilityfoundation.org/) is a powerful open-source tool for analyzing memory images. It offers some extremely useful plugins. Each artifact can be analyzed using a specific plugin.


## Practical Example of Digital Forensics

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Pdfinfo</span> displays various metadata related to a PDF file, such as title, subject, author, creator, and creation date.

#### Photo EXIF Data

EXIF stands for Exchangeable Image File Format; it is a standard for saving metadata to image files. Whenever you take a photo with your smartphone or with your digital camera, plenty of information gets embedded in the image. The following are examples of metadata that can be found in the original digital images:

- Camera model / Smartphone model
- Date and time of image capture
- Photo settings such as focal length, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">ExifTool</span> is used to read and write metadata in various file types, such as JPEG images.

# Incident Response Fundamentals

## Introduction to Incident Response

Incident Response handles an incident from its start to end. From deploying security in several areas to prevent incidents to fighting with them, and minimizing their impact, incident response is a thorough guideline.

## What are Incidents?

Some processes are interactive meaning you performed the actions. There are also noninteractive processes running in the background that may not require your interaction with them. Both are necessary for your device. Both log events for anything they do. 

The alerts that point to something dangerous but are not harmful are referred to as **false positives**. In contrast, the alerts that point to something harmful and are actually dangerous are called **true positives**. These true positive alerts are sometimes referred to as **Incidents**.  After the alert is categorized as an incident, the next phase is to give a severity level to the incident.

## Types of Incidents

**Malware Infections**: Malware is a malicious program that can damage a system, network, or application. The majority of incidents are associated with malware infections.
**Security Breaches:** Security Breaches arise when an unauthorized person gets access to confidential data (something we don’t want them to see or have).
**Data Leaks:** Data leaks are incidents in which confidential information of an individual or an organization is exposed to unauthorized entities. Many attackers use data leaks for reputational damage to their victims or to threaten their victims and get what they need from them.
**Insider Attacks:** Incidents from within an organization are known as insider attacks.
**Denial Of Service Attacks:** Denial of Service attacks, or DoS attacks, are incidents where the attacker floods a system/network/application with false requests, eventually making it unavailable to legitimate users.

## Incident Response Techniques

There are multiple security solutions that serve their own unique roles in detecting any incidents. Some of them even have the capability to respond to the incidents and execute the other phases of the lifecycle, such as containment, eradication, etc:

- **SIEM**: collects all important logs in one centralized location and correlates them to identify incidents
- **AV**: detects known malicious programs in a system and regularly scans your system for them
- **EDR**: Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is deployed on every system, protecting it against some advanced-level threats. This solution can also contain and eradicate the threat.

Playbooks: Step-by-step comprehensive guidelines for incident response  including investigating the extent of the attack, taking necessary actions to prevent further damage and eliminating it from the root. These steps may be different for different kinds of incidents.

# Logs Fundamentals

There are various places inside a system where the traces of an attack could be fetched. The logs contain most of these traces. Logs are the digital footprints left behind by any activity.

## Types of Logs

Logs are segregated into multiple categories according to the type of information that they provide. 

| Log Type         | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                            | Example                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| System Logs      | The system logs can be helpful in troubleshooting running issues in the OS. These logs provide information on various operating system activities.                                               | - System Startup and shutdown events  <br>- Driver Loading events  <br>- System Error events  <br>- Hardware events                                    |
| Security Logs    | The security logs help detect and investigate incidents. These logs provide information on the security-related activities in the system.                                                        | -Authentication events  <br>- Authorization events  <br>- Security Policy changes events  <br>- User Account changes events - Abnormal Activity events |
| Application Logs | The application logs contain specific events related to the application. Any interactive or non-interactive activity happening inside the application will be logged here.                       | - User Interaction events  <br>- Application Changes events  <br>- Application Update events <br>- Application Error events                            |
| Audit Logs       | The Audit logs provide detailed information on the system changes and user events. These logs are helpful for compliance requirements and can play a vital role in security monitoring as well.  | - Data Access events  <br>- System Change events  <br>- User Activity events  <br>- Policy Enforcement events                                          |
| Network Logs     | Network logs provide information on the network’s outgoing and incoming traffic. They play crucial roles in troubleshooting network issues and can also be handy during incident investigations. | - Incoming Network Traffic events  <br>- Outgoing Network Traffic events  <br>- Network Connection Logs - Network Firewall Logs                        |
| Access Logs      | The Access logs provide detailed information about the access to different resources. These resources can be of different types, providing us with information on their access.                  | - Webserver Access Logs  <br>- Database Access Logs - Application Access Logs  <br>- API Access Logs                                                   |

Log Analysis is a technique for extracting valuable data from logs. It involves looking for any signs of abnormal or unusual activities.

## Windows Event Logs Analysis

Numerous event IDs are available in Windows event logs. We can use these event IDs to search for any specific activity. 

4624	A user account successfully logged in
4625	A user account failed to login
4634	A user account successfully logged off
4720	A user account was created
4724	An attempt was made to reset an account’s password
4722	A user account was enabled
4725	A user account was disabled
4726	A user account was deleted

  
## Web Server Access Logs Analysis

All  requests are logged by the website and stored in a log file on the web server running that website.

We can use the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">cat</span> command to display the contents of a log file, as they are typically in the text format.

```
cat access.log
```

Most systems rotate the logs regularly. This rotation helps them create individual log files for specific timeframes and not carry them all in a single log file. We can combine the results of multiple files within one single file, as shown below.

```
cat access1.log access2.log > combined_access.log
```

<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">grep</span> is useful for searching for strings and patterns inside a log file.

The <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">less</span> command is helpful for handling multiple log files. Use <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">spacebar</mark> to move to the next page and <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">b</mark> to the previous page.  If you wish to search for something in the logs, you can type <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">/ </mark>followed by the pattern you are searching for and hit enter.
