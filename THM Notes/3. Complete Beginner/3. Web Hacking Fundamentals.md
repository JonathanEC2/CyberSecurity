# How Websites Work

Front End (Client-Side) - the way your browser renders a website.
Back End (Server-Side) - a server that processes your request and returns a response.

## HTML

Websites are primarily created using:

- **HTML**, to build websites and define their structure
- **CSS**, to make websites look pretty by adding styling options
- **JavaScript**, implement complex features on pages using interactivity

## HTML Injection

HTML Injection is a vulnerability that occurs when unfiltered user input is displayed on the page.  

# HTTP in Detail

-  **HTTP** is the set of rules used for communicating with web servers for the transmission of webpage data, whether that is HTML, Images, Videos, etc.
-  A **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator)  is predominantly an instruction on how to access a resource on the internet.

## Requests And Responses

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf__gYArIkIwQwP7V3VzTwCcrMkRRqxqBzmGbm7x9qiiD3HP_QryZeIg_K4WE_39DqlM0WrbdcFiUMiwmRf7ZHVQf5QHPP_tSfSWuM-Vr2PXPgVyet6nD79-Lh4bnyvO52i4XjG5ScAT2HSBHl8MmewdZmu?key=TfE_5MxENIjRvhHpOZCQ2w)

## HTTP Methods

HTTP methods are a way for the client to show their intended action when making an HTTP request.

- **GET** Request is used to get information from a web server.
- **POST** Request is used for submitting data to the web server and potentially creating new records
- **PUT** Request  is used for submitting data to a web server to update information
- **DELETE** Request is used to delete information/records from a web server.
 
## HTTP Status Codes

| 100-199 - Information Response | These are sent to tell the client the first part of their request has been accepted and they should continue sending the rest of their request. These codes are no longer very common. |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200-299 - Success              | This range of status codes is used to tell the client their request was successful.                                                                                                    |
| 300-399 - Redirection          | These are used to redirect the client's request to another resource. This can be either to a different webpage or a different website altogether.                                      |
| 400-499 - Client Errors        | Used to inform the client that there was an error with their request.                                                                                                                  |
| 500-599 - Server Errors        | This is reserved for errors happening on the server-side and usually indicates quite a major problem with the server handling the request.                                             |

| 200 - OK                     | The request was completed successfully.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 201 - Created                | A resource has been created (for example a new user or new blog post).                                                                                                                                                       |
| 301 - Moved Permanently      | This redirects the client's browser to a new webpage or tells search engines that the page has moved somewhere else and to look there instead.                                                                               |
| 302 - Found                  | Similar to the above permanent redirect, but as the name suggests, this is only a temporary change and it may change again in the near future.                                                                               |
| 400 - Bad Request            | This tells the browser that something was either wrong or missing in their request. This could sometimes be used if the web server resource that is being requested expects a certain parameter that the client didn't send. |
| 401 - Not Authorized         | You are not currently allowed to view this resource until you have authorized with the web application, most commonly with a username and password.                                                                          |
| 403 - Forbidden              | You do not have permission to view this resource whether you are logged in or not.                                                                                                                                           |
| 405 - Method Not Allowed     | The resource does not allow this method request, for example, you send a GET request to the resource /create-account when it was expecting a POST request instead.                                                           |
| 404 - Page Not Found         | The page/resource you requested does not exist.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 500 - Internal Service Error | The server has encountered some kind of error with your request that it doesn't know how to handle properly.                                                                                                                 |
| 503 - Service Unavailable    | This server cannot handle your request as it's either overloaded or down for maintenance.                                                                                                                                    |

## Headers

Headers are additional bits of data you can send to the web server when making requests.

<font size = 4><b>Common Request Headers:</b></font>
- Host: by providing the host headers you can tell it which website you require, otherwise you'll just receive the default website for the server.
- User-Agent: This is your browser software and version number
- Content-Length: tells the web server how much data to expect in the web request. This way the server can ensure it isn't missing any data.
- Accept-Encoding: Tells the web server what types of compression methods the browser supports so the data can be made smaller for transmitting over the internet.
- Cookie: Data sent to the server to help remember your information

 <font size = 4><b>Common Response Headers:</b></font>
- Set-Cookie: Information to store which gets sent back to the web server on each request 
- Cache-Control: How long to store the content of the response in the browser's cache before it requests it again.
- Content-Type: This tells the client what type of data is being returned, i.e., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Images, PDF, Video, etc. Using the content-type header the browser then knows how to process the data.
- Content-Encoding: What method has been used to compress the data to make it smaller when sending it over the internet.

## Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your computer. Cookies are saved when you receive a "Set-Cookie" header from a web server. Because HTTP is stateless (doesn't keep track of your previous requests), cookies can be used to remind the web server who you are. Cookies are most commonly used for website authentication.

# Burp Suite: The Basics

 Burp Suite is a Java-based framework designed to serve as a comprehensive solution for conducting web application penetration testing. It is the industry standard tool for hands-on security assessments of web and mobile applications, including those that rely on application programming interfaces (APIs).

## The Dashboard

The Burp Dashboard is divided into four quadrants, as labeled in counter-clockwise order starting from the top left:


1. Tasks: The Tasks menu allows you to define background tasks that Burp Suite will perform while you use the application. In Burp Suite Community, the default “Live Passive Crawl” task, which automatically logs the pages visited, is sufficient for our purposes in this module. Burp Suite Professional offers additional features like on-demand scans.
2. Event log: The Event log provides information about the actions performed by Burp Suite, such as starting the proxy, as well as details about connections made through Burp.
3. Issue Activity: This section is specific to Burp Suite Professional. It displays the vulnerabilities identified by the automated scanner, ranked by severity and filterable based on the certainty of the vulnerability.
4. Advisory: The Advisory section provides more detailed information about the identified vulnerabilities, including references and suggested remediation's. This information can be exported into a report. In Burp Suite Community, this section may not show any vulnerabilities.

## The Burp Suite Browser

The Burp Proxy is a fundamental and crucial tool within Burp Suite. It enables the capture of requests and responses between the user and the target web server. This intercepted traffic can be manipulated, sent to other tools for further processing, or explicitly allowed to continue to its destination.

- When the proxy configuration is active, and the intercept is switched on in Burp Suite, your browser will hang whenever you make a request.
- Be cautious not to leave the intercept switched on unintentionally, as it can prevent your browser from making any requests.
- Right-clicking on a request in Burp Suite allows you to perform various actions, such as forwarding, dropping, sending to other tools, or selecting options from the right-click menu.
   
## Site Map and Issue Definitions

- Site map: This sub-tab allows us to map out the web applications we are targeting in a tree structure. Every page that we visit while the proxy is active will be displayed on the site map. 
- Issue definitions: provides an extensive list of web vulnerabilities, complete with descriptions and references. 
- Scope settings: This setting allows us to control the target scope in Burp Suite. It enables us to include or exclude specific domains/IPs to define the scope of our testing.

## Scoping and Targeting

By setting a scope for the project, we can define what gets proxied and logged in Burp Suite. We can restrict Burp Suite to target only the specific web application(s) we want to test. The easiest way to do this is by switching to the **Target** tab, right-clicking on our target from the list on the left, and selecting **Add To Scope**. Burp will then prompt us to choose whether we want to stop logging anything that is not in scope, and in most cases, we want to select **yes**. 

The Scope settings window allows us to control our target scope by including or excluding domains/IPs. This section is powerful and worth spending time getting familiar with.

However, even if we disabled logging for out-of-scope traffic, the proxy will still intercept everything. To prevent this, we need to go to the **Proxy settings** sub-tab and select **And URL Is in target scope** from the "Intercept Client Requests" section.

Fortunately for us, client-side filters are absurdly easy to bypass. There are a variety of ways we could disable the script or just prevent it from loading in the first place.

With the request captured in the proxy, we can now change the email field to be our very simple payload from above: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">{script}alert("Succ3ssful XSS"){/script}</span>. After pasting in the payload, we need to select it, then URL encode it with the Ctrl + U shortcut to make it safe to send. 

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">To further enhance your skills, I encourage you to practice and experiment with Burp Suite.</mark> Explore its features, try different configurations, and familiarize yourself with its various tools. The more you use Burp Suite, the more proficient you will become in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications.


# OWASP Top 10 - 2021

Open Web Application Security Project

## Broken Access Control  
 Allows attackers to bypass authorization, allowing them to view sensitive data or perform tasks they aren't supposed to.

 IDOR or Insecure Direct Object Reference refers to an access control vulnerability where you can access resources you wouldn't ordinarily be able to see. 

## Cryptographic Failures

Any vulnerability arising from the misuse (or lack of use) of cryptographic algorithms for protecting sensitive information.

In a production environment, it is common to see databases set up on dedicated servers running a database service such as MySQL or MariaDB; however, databases can also be stored as files. These are referred to as "**flat-file**" databases, as they are stored as a single file on the computer.

The most common (and simplest) format of a flat-file database is an SQLite database. **Sqlite3**  dedicated client for querying flat-files

- To access db file, we use <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">sqlite3 {database-name}</span>
- From here, we can see the tables in the database by using the <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">.tables</span> command:
-  use <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">PRAGMA table_info(table_name)</span>;
-  use <span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">SELECT * FROM table_name</span>; to dump the information from the table:

## Injection

- SQL Injection: This occurs when user-controlled input is passed to SQL queries. As a result, an attacker can pass in SQL queries to manipulate the outcome of such queries. This could potentially allow the attacker to access, modify and delete information in a database when this input is passed into database queries.

- Command Injection: This occurs when user input is passed to system commands. As a result, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on application servers, potentially allowing them to access users' systems.

## Insecure Design

 Insecure design refers to vulnerabilities that are inherent to the application's architecture. . They are not vulnerabilities regarding bad implementations or configurations, but the idea behind the whole application (or a part of it) is flawed from the start. 
  

## Security Misconfiguration

- Poorly configured permissions on cloud services, like S3 buckets.
- Having unnecessary features enabled, like services, pages, accounts or privileges.
- Default accounts with unchanged passwords.
- Error messages that are overly detailed and allow attackers to find out more about the system.
- Not using HTTP security headers.

## Vulnerable and Outdated Components

If a company misses a single update for a program they use, it could be vulnerable to any number of attacks.

 It helps to understand the programming language the script is in so that, if needed, you can fix any bugs or make any modifications, as quite a few scripts on Exploit-DB expect you to make modifications 

## Identification and Authentication Failures

-  Authentication allows users to gain access to web applications by verifying their identities. 
- Many times, developers forget to sanitize the input(username & password) given by the user in the code of their application, which can make them vulnerable to attacks like SQL injection.
-  re-registration of an existing user

## Software and Data Integrity Failures

 When discussing integrity, we refer to the capacity to ascertain that a piece of data remains unmodified. Integrity is essential in cybersecurity as we care about maintaining important data free from unwanted or malicious modifications. 
 
 Usually, when a user logs into an application, they will be assigned some sort of session token that will need to be saved on the browser for as long as the session lasts. This token will be repeated on each subsequent request so that the web application knows who we are. These session tokens can come in many forms but are usually assigned via cookies. **Cookies** are key-value pairs that a web application will store on the user's browser and that will be automatically repeated on each request to the website that issued them.

- SEE LESSON FOR JWT ALGORITHM


## Security Logging & Monitoring Failures

- Logging is important because, in the event of an incident, the attackers' activities can be traced. Once their actions are traced, their risk and impact can be determined. Without logging, there would be no way to tell what actions were performed by an attacker if they gain access to particular web applications.


## Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

-This type of vulnerability occurs when an attacker can coerce a web application into sending requests on their behalf to arbitrary destinations while having control of the contents of the request itself.
