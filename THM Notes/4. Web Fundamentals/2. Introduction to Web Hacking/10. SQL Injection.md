#review

SQL injection (SQLi) is an attack on a web application database server that causes malicious requests to be executed. When a web application communicates with a database using input from a user that has not been properly validated, there is potential of an attacker being able to steal, delete, or alter private and customer data and also attack the web applications authentication methods. 


# What is a Database?

A database is a way of electronically storing collections of data in an organized manner. A database is controlled by a DBMS. DBMS are categorized as relational or non=relational

Within a DBMS, you can have multiple databases, each containing its own set of related data. You'd store this information separately in the database using something called tables. The tables are identified with a unique name for each one.

**What are tables?**

A table is made up of columns and rows;

**Columns:**

Each column, better referred to as a field, has a unique name per table. When creating a column, you also set the type of data it will contain, common ones being integers (numbers), strings (standard text) or dates. Setting the data type also ensures that incorrect information isn't stored, such as the string "hello world" being stored in a column meant for dates.

# What is SQL?

SQL is a language used for querying databases. SQL queries are better referred to as statements. **SQL syntax is not case-sensitive**.

#### SELECT

Used to retrieve data from the database. The word SELECT, tells the database we want to retrieve some data; the * tells the database we want to receive back all columns from the table.

``` sql
select * from users;
```

The below query is similar to the first, but instead just requests the username and password field.

``` sql
select username,password from users;
```

The next query returns all columns by using the * selector and then the "LIMIT 1" clause to return only one row of data. Changing the query to "LIMIT 1,1" forces the query to skip the first result, and then "LIMIT 2,1" skips the first two results, and so on. The first number tells the database how many results you wish to skip, and the second number tells the database how many rows to return.

``` sql
select * from users LIMIT 1;
```

<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">where</span> clause allows you to finely pick out the exact data we require by returning data that matches our specific clauses:

```sql
select * from users where username='admin';
```

<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">like</span> clause allows you to specify data that isn't an exact match but instead either starts, contains or ends with certain characters by choosing where to place the wildcard character represented by a percentage sign %.

``` sql
select * from users where username like 'a%';
```

#### UNION

The UNION statement combines the results of two or more SELECT statements to retrieve data from either single or multiple tables; the rules to this query are that the UNION statement must retrieve the same number of columns in each SELECT statement, the columns have to be of a similar data type, and the column order has to be the same.

#### INSERT

The INSERT statement tells the database we wish to insert a new row of data into the table.

``` SQL
insert into users (username,password) values ('bob','password123');
```

#### UPDATE

The UPDATE statement tells the database we wish to update one or more rows of data within a table

```SQL
update users SET username='root',password='pass123' where username='admin';
```

#### DELETE

The DELETE statement tells the database we wish to delete one or more rows of data.

``` SQL
delete from users where username='martin';
```

# What is SQL Injection

The point wherein a web application using SQL can turn into SQL Injection is when user-provided data gets included in the SQL query.

Take the following scenario where you've come across an online blog, and each blog entry has a unique ID number. The blog entries may be either set to public or private, depending on whether they're ready for public release. The URL for each blog entry may look something like this:  
  
`https://website.thm/blog?id=1`

From the URL above, you can see that the blog entry selected comes from the id parameter in the query string. The web app may use an SQL statement that looks something like:

`SELECT * from blog where id=1 and private=0 LIMIT 1;`

In this instance, the id parameter from the query string is used directly in the SQL query.  
  
Let's pretend article ID 2 is still locked as private, so it cannot be viewed on the website. We could now instead call the URL:  

`https://website.thm/blog?id=2;--`

**The semicolon in the URL signifies the end of the SQL statement, and the two dashes cause everything afterwards to be treated as a comment**. By doing this, you're just, in fact, running the query:  
  
`SELECT * from blog where id=2;--`  
  
Which will return the article with an ID of 2 whether it is set to public or not.

# In-Band SQLi

In-band refers to the same method of communication being used to exploit the vulnerability and also receive the results, for example, discovering an SQL Injection vulnerability on a website page and then being able to extract data from the database to the same page.

#### Error-Based SQLi

Error messages from databases are printed directly to the browser screen. This can often be used to enumerate the entire database. 

#### Union-Based SQLi

Utilizes SQL union alongside a SELECT statement to return additional results to the page. This is the most common way of extracting large amounts of data via SQLi vulnerability. 


The key to discovering error-based SQL Injection is to break the code's SQL query by trying certain characters until an error message is produced; these are most commonly single apostrophes ( ' ) or a quotation mark ( " ). Receiving an error message confirms the existence of an SQL Injection vulnerability.

# Blind SQLi - Authentication Bypass

Unlike In-Band SQL injection, where we can see the results of our attack directly on the screen, blind SQLi is when we get little to no feedback to confirm whether our injected queries were, in fact, successful or not, this is because the error messages have been disabled, but the injection still works regardless.

#### Authentication Bypass

One of the most straightforward Blind SQL Injection techniques is when bypassing authentication methods such as login forms. In this instance, we aren't that interested in retrieving data from the database; We just want to get past the login. 

Login forms that are connected to a database of users are often developed in such a way that the web application isn't interested in the content of the username and password but more in whether the two make a matching pair in the users table

 The box labelled "SQL Query" that the query to the database is the following:

`select * from users where username='%username%' and password='%password%' LIMIT 1;`

To make this into a query that always returns as true, we can enter the following into the password field:

`' OR 1=1;--`

Which turns the SQL query into the following:

`select * from users where username='' and password='' OR 1=1;`

Because 1=1 is a true statement and we've used an **OR** operator, this will always cause the query to return as true, which satisfies the web applications logic that the database found a valid username/password combination and that access should be allowed.

# Blind SQLi - Boolean Based

Boolean-based SQL Injection refers to the response we receive from our injection attempts, which could be a true/false, yes/no, on/off, 1/0 or any response that can only have two outcomes.


# Blind SQLi - Time Based

A time-based blind SQL injection is very similar to the above boolean-based one in that the same requests are sent, but there is no visual indicator of your queries being wrong or right this time. Instead, your indicator of a correct query is based on the time the query takes to complete. This time delay is introduced using built-in methods such as SLEEP(x) alongside the UNION statement. The SLEEP() method will only ever get executed upon a successful UNION SELECT statement. 

# Out-of-Band SQLi

An Out-Of-Band attack is classified by having two different communication channels, one to launch the attack and the other to gather the results. For example, the attack channel could be a web request, and the data gathering channel could be monitoring HTTP/DNS requests made to a service you control.

1) An attacker makes a request to a website vulnerable to SQL Injection with an injection payload.

2) The Website makes an SQL query to the database, which also passes the hacker's payload.

3) The payload contains a request which forces an HTTP request back to the hacker's machine containing data from the database.
