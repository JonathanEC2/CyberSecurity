# File Inclusion

In some scenarios, web applications are written to request access to files on a given system, including images, static text, and so on via parameters. Parameters are query parameter strings attached to the URL that could be used to retrieve data or perform actions based on user input.

For example, parameters are used with Google searching, where GET requests pass user input into the search engine.

File inclusion vulnerabilities are commonly found and exploited in various programming languages for web applications, such as PHP that are poorly written and implemented. The main issue of these vulnerabilities is the input validation, in which the user inputs are not sanitized or validated, and the user controls them. By default, an attacker can leverage file inclusion vulnerabilities to leak data, such as code, credentials or other important files related to the web application or operating system.

## Path Traversal

Also known as Directory traversal, a web security vulnerability allows an attacker to read operating system resources, such as local files on the server running an application. The attacker exploits this vulnerability by manipulating and abusing the web application's URL to locate and access files or directories stored outside the application's root directory.

Path traversal vulnerabilities occur when the user's input is passed to a function such as file_get_contents in PHP. 

 Path traversal attacks, also known as the dot-dot-slash attack, take advantage of moving the directory one step up using the double dots ../ .  If the attacker finds the entry point, which in this case get.php?file=, then the attacker may send something as follows, http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd

## Local File Inclusion - LFI

**Scenario 1**

With PHP, using functions such as include, require, include_once, and require_once often contribute to vulnerable web applications.  LFI vulnerabilities also occur when using other languages such as ASP, JSP, or even in Node.js apps. LFI exploits follow the same concepts as path traversal.

Suppose the web application provides two languages, and the user can select between the EN and AR

```php
<?PHP 
	include($_GET["lang"]);
?>
```

The PHP code above uses a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">GET</span> request via the URL parameter <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lang</span> to include the file of the page. The call can be done by sending the following HTTP request as follows: http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=EN.php to load the English page or http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=AR.php to load the Arabic page, where EN.php and AR.php files exist in the same directory.

Theoretically, we can access and display any readable file on the server from the code above if there isn't any input validation. Let's say we want to read the /etc/passwd file, which contains sensitive information about the users of the Linux operating system, we can try the following: http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=THM-profile

**Scenario 2**

```php
<?PHP 
	include("languages/". $_GET['lang']); 
?>
```

In the above code, the developer decided to use the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">include</mark> function to call PHP pages in the languages directory only via lang parameters. Again the payload looks similar to the path traversal, but the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">include</mark> function allows us to include any called files into the current page. The following will be the exploit:

http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=../../../../etc/passwd


## Local File Inclusion - LFI #2

**Scenario 3**
In this scenario, we have the following entry point: http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=EN. If we enter an invalid input, such as **THM**, we get the following error


```php
Warning: include(languages/THM.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/THM-4/index.php on line 12
```

We can tell the function includes files in the languages directory is adding .php at the end of the entry. Thus the valid input will be something as follows: index.php?lang=EN, where the file EN is located inside the given languages directory and named EN.php.

Also, the error message disclosed another important piece of information about the full web application directory path which is <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">/var/www/html/THM-4/</span> . To exploit this, we need to use the ../

Using null bytes is an injection technique where URL-encoded representation such as %00 or 0x00 in hex with user-supplied data to terminate strings. You could think of it as trying to trick the web app into disregarding whatever comes after the Null Byte.

By adding the Null Byte at the end of the payload, we tell the include function to ignore anything after the null byte which may look like:

`include("languages/../../../../../etc/passwd%00").".php");` which is equivalent to `include("languages/../../../../../etc/passwd");`

**Note: the %00 trick is fixed and not working with PHP 5.3.4 and above.**

**Scenario 4**

 The developer decided to filter keywords to avoid disclosing sensitive information. The <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">/etc/passwd</span> file is being filtered. There are two possible methods to bypass the filter. First, by using the NullByte %00 or the current directory trick at the end of the filtered keyword `/..` The exploit will be similar to `http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=/etc/passwd/.`  We could also use `http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=/etc/passwd%00`.

To make it clearer, if we try this concept in the file system using `cd ..`, it will get you back one step; however, if you do `cd .`, It stays in the current directory. Similarly, if we try `/etc/passwd/..`, it results to be `/etc/` and that's because we moved one to the root. Now if we try `/etc/passwd/.`, the result will be `/etc/passwd` since dot refers to the current directory.

**Scenario 5**

In the following scenarios, the developer starts to use input validation by filtering some keywords. Let's test out and check the error message!

http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=../../../../etc/passwd

```php
Warning: include(languages/etc/passwd): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/THM-5/index.php on line 15
```

If we check the warning message in the include(languages/etc/passwd) section, we know that the web application replaces the ../ with the empty string. 

First, we can send the following payload to bypass it: ....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd. This works because the PHP filter only matches and replaces the first subset string ../

If developer forces the include to read from a defined directory, we need to include the directory in the payload like so:<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;"> ?lang=languages/../../../../../etc/passwd</mark>
