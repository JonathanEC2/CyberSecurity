# What is an SSRF?

Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a web vulnerability where an attacker manipulates a vulnerable application to make requests to internal or external resources on behalf of the server.

#### Types of SSRF

Regular - data is returned to the attackers screem
Blind - SSRF occurs but no information is returned to an attackers screen

# SSRF Examples

**Ex 1** The below example shows how the attacker can have complete control over the page requested by the webserver. The Expected Request is what the website.thm server is expecting to receive, with the section in red being the URL that the website will fetch for the information.
The attacker can modify the area in red to an URL of their choice.

**Ex 2** The below example shows how an attacker can still reach the /api/user page with only having control over the path by utilizing directory traversal. When website.thm receives ../ this is a message to move up a directory which removes the /stock portion of the request and turns the final request into /api/user

**Ex 3** In this example, the attacker can control the server's subdomain to which the request is made. Take note of the payload ending in <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">&x=</mark> being used to stop the remaining path from being appended to the end of the attacker's URL and instead turns it into a parameter (?x=) on the query string.

# Finding an SSRF

Potential SSRF vulnerabilities can be spotted in web applications in many different ways. Here is an example of four common places to look:

When a full URL is used in a parameter in the address bar:

A hidden field in a form:

A partial URL such as just the hostname:

Or perhaps only the path of the URL:

# Defeating Common SSRF Defenses

**Deny List**

A Deny List is where all requests are accepted apart from resources specified in a list or matching a particular pattern.  A Web Application may employ a deny list to protect sensitive endpoints, IP addresses or domains from being accessed by the public while still allowing access to other locations. Attackers can bypass a Deny List by using alternative localhost references such as 0, 0.0.0.0, 0000, 127.1, 127.\*.\*.\*, 2130706433, 017700000001 or subdomains that have a DNS record which resolves to the IP Address 127.0.0.1 such as 127.0.0.1.nip.io. 

Also, in a cloud environment, it would be beneficial to block access to the IP address 169.254.169.254, which contains metadata for the deployed cloud server, including possibly sensitive information. An attacker can bypass this by registering a subdomain on their own domain with a DNS record that points to the IP Address 169.254.169.254.

**Allow List**

An allow list is where all requests get denied unless they appear on a list or match a particular pattern, such as a rule that an URL used in a parameter must begin with **https://website.thm.** An attacker could quickly circumvent this rule by creating a subdomain on an attacker's domain name, such as https://website.thm.attackers-domain.thm. The application logic would now allow this input and let an attacker control the internal HTTP request.

**Open Redirect**

 An open redirect is an endpoint on the server where the website visitor gets automatically redirected to another website address. Take, for example, the link https://website.thm/link?url=https://tryhackme.com. This endpoint was created to record the number of times visitors have clicked on this link for advertising/marketing purposes. But imagine there was a potential SSRF vulnerability with stringent rules which only allowed URLs beginning with https://website.thm/. An attacker could utilise the above feature to redirect the internal HTTP request to a domain of the attacker's choice.
