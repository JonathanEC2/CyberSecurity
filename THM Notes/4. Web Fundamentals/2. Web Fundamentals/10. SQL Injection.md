SQL injection (SQLi) is an attack on a web application database server that causes malicious requests to be executed. When a web application communicates with a database using input from a user that has not been properly validated, there is potential of an attacker being able to steal, delete, or alter private and customer data and also attack the web applications authentication methods. 


# What is a Database?

A database is a way of electronically storing collections of data in an organized manner. A database is controlled by a DBMS. DBMS are categorized as relational or non=relational

Within a DBMS, you can have multiple databases, each containing its own set of related data. You'd store this information separately in the database using something called tables. The tables are identified with a unique name for each one.

**What are tables?**

A table is made up of columns and rows;

**Columns:**

Each column, better referred to as a field, has a unique name per table. When creating a column, you also set the type of data it will contain, common ones being integers (numbers), strings (standard text) or dates. Setting the data type also ensures that incorrect information isn't stored, such as the string "hello world" being stored in a column meant for dates.

# What is SQL?

SQL is a language used for querying databases. SQL queries are better referred to as statements. **SQL syntax is not case-sensitive**.

#### SELECT

Used to retrieve data from the database. The word SELECT, tells the database we want to retrieve some data; the * tells the database we want to receive back all columns from the table.

``` sql
select * from users;
```

The below query is similar to the first, but instead just requests the username and password field.

``` sql
select username,password from users;
```

The next query returns all columns by using the * selector and then the "LIMIT 1" clause to return only one row of data. Changing the query to "LIMIT 1,1" forces the query to skip the first result, and then "LIMIT 2,1" skips the first two results, and so on. The first number tells the database how many results you wish to skip, and the second number tells the database how many rows to return.

``` sql
select * from users LIMIT 1;
```

<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">where</span> clause allows you to finely pick out the exact data we require by returning data that matches our specific clauses:

```sql
select * from users where username='admin';
```

<span style="color:rgb(255, 192, 0)">like</span> clause allows you to specify data that isn't an exact match but instead either starts, contains or ends with certain characters by choosing where to place the wildcard character represented by a percentage sign %.

``` sql
select * from users where username like 'a%';
```

#### UNION

The UNION statement combines the results of two or more SELECT statements to retrieve data from either single or multiple tables; the rules to this query are that the UNION statement must retrieve the same number of columns in each SELECT statement, the columns have to be of a similar data type, and the column order has to be the same.

#### INSERT

The INSERT statement tells the database we wish to insert a new row of data into the table.

``` SQL
insert into users (username,password) values ('bob','password123');
```

#### UPDATE

The UPDATE statement tells the database we wish to update one or more rows of data within a table

```SQL
update users SET username='root',password='pass123' where username='admin';
```

#### DELETE

The DELETE statement tells the database we wish to delete one or more rows of data.

``` SQL
delete from users where username='martin';
```
